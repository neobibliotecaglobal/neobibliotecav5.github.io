<p class="ChapterIntro">Version control software allows you to take snapshots of a project whenever it’s in a working state. When you make changes to a project—for example, when you implement a new feature—you can go back to a previous working state if the project’s current state isn’t functioning well.</p>
<p>Using version control software gives you the freedom to work on improvements and make mistakes without worrying about ruining your project. This is especially critical in large projects, but can also be helpful in smaller projects, even when you’re working on programs contained in a single file.</p>
<p>In this appendix, you’ll learn to install Git and use it for version control in the programs you’re working on now. <em>Git</em> is the most popular version control software in use today. Many of its advanced tools help teams collaborate on large projects, but its most basic features also work well for solo developers. Git implements version control by tracking the changes made to every file in a project; if you make a mistake, you can just return to a previously saved state.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_484" title="484"></span>Installing Git</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Git runs on all operating systems, but there are different approaches to installing it on each system. The following sections provide specific instructions for each operating system.</p>
<p>Git is included on some systems by default, and is often bundled with other packages that you might have already installed. Before trying to install Git, see if it’s already on your system. Open a new terminal window and issue the command <code class="bold">git --version</code>. If you see output listing a specific version number, Git is installed on your system. If you see a message prompting you to install or update Git, follow the onscreen instructions.</p>
<p>If you don’t see any onscreen instructions and you’re using Windows or macOS, you can download an installer from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a>. If you’re a Linux user with an apt-compatible system, you can install Git with the command <code class="bold">sudo apt install git</code>.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b04-0001">Configuring Git</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Git keeps track of who makes changes to a project, even when only one person is working on the project. To do this, Git needs to know your username and email. You must provide a username, but you can make up a fake email address:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>git config --global user.name "</b><var class="bold">username</var><b>"</b>
$ <b>git config --global user.email "</b><var class="bold">username@example.com</var><b>"</b></code></pre>
<p>If you forget this step, Git will prompt you for this information when you make your first commit.</p>
<p>It’s also best to set the default name for the main branch in each project. A good name for this branch is <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>git config --global init.defaultBranch main</b></code></pre>
<p>This configuration means that each new project you use Git to manage will start out with a single branch of commits called <em>main</em>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0002">Making a Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s make a project to work with. Create a folder somewhere on your system called <em>git_practice</em>. Inside the folder, make a simple Python program:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>hello_git.py</b></p>
<pre><code>print("Hello Git world!")</code></pre>
<p>We’ll use this program to explore Git’s basic functionality.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0003">Ignoring Files</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Files with the extension <em>.pyc</em> are automatically generated from <em>.py</em> files, so we don’t need Git to keep track of them. These files are stored in a directory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_485" title="485"></span>called <em>__pycache__</em>. To tell Git to ignore this directory, make a special file called <em>.gitignore</em>—with a dot at the beginning of the filename and no file extension—and add the following line to it:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>.gitignore</b></p>
<pre><code>__pycache__/</code></pre>
<p>This file tells Git to ignore any file in the <em>__pycache__</em> directory. Using a <em>.gitignore</em> file will keep your project clutter-free and easier to work with.</p>
<p>You might need to modify your file browser’s settings so hidden files (files whose names begin with a dot) will be shown. In Windows Explorer, check the box in the View menu labeled <b>Hidden Items</b>. On macOS, press ⌘-SHIFT-. (dot). On Linux, look for a setting labeled Show Hidden Files.</p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>
<p>	If you’re on macOS, add one more line to <em>.gitignore</em>. Add the name <code>.DS_Store</code>; these are hidden files that contain information about each directory on macOS, and they will clutter up your project if you don’t add them to <em>.gitignore</em>.</p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>

<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0004">Initializing a Repository</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Now that you have a directory containing a Python file and a <em>.gitignore</em> file, you can initialize a Git repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the <em>git_practice</em> folder, and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git init</b>
Initialized empty Git repository in git_practice/.git/
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>The output shows that Git has initialized an empty repository in <em>git_practice</em>. A <em>repository</em> is the set of files in a program that Git is actively tracking. All the files Git uses to manage the repository are located in the hidden directory <em>.git</em>, which you won’t need to work with at all. Just don’t delete that directory, or you’ll lose your project’s history.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0005">Checking the Status</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Before doing anything else, let’s look at the project’s status:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> On branch main
No commits yet

<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
      .gitignore
      hello_git.py

<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_486" title="486"></span>In Git, a <em>branch</em> is a version of the project you’re working on; here you can see that we’re on a branch named <code>main</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. Each time you check your project’s status, it should show that you’re on the branch <code>main</code>. You then see that we’re about to make the initial commit. A <em>commit</em> is a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time.</p>
<p>Git informs us that untracked files are in the project <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>, because we haven’t told it which files to track yet. Then we’re told that there’s nothing added to the current commit, but untracked files are present that we might want to add to the repository <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0006">Adding Files to the Repository</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s add the two files to the repository and check the status again:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> git_practice$ <b>git add .</b>
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span>       new file:   .gitignore
      new file:   hello_git.py

git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>git add .</code> adds to the repository all files within a project that aren’t already being tracked <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>, as long as they’re not listed in <em>.gitignore</em>. It doesn’t commit the files; it just tells Git to start paying attention to them. When we check the status of the project now, we can see that Git recognizes some changes that need to be committed <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. The label <em>new file</em> means these files were newly added to the repository <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0007">Making a Commit</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s make the first commit:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> git_practice$ <b>git commit -m "Started project."</b>
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> [main (root-commit) cea13dd] Started project.
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> 2 files changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 hello_git.py
<span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❹</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>We issue the command <code>git commit -m "</code><var>message</var><code>"</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> to make a snapshot of the project. The <code>-m</code> flag tells Git to record the message that follows (<code>Started </code><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_487" title="487"></span>project.) in the project’s log. The output shows that we’re on the <code>main</code> branch <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span> and that two files have changed <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>.</p>
<p>When we check the status now, we can see that we’re on the <code>main</code> branch, and we have a clean working tree <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">❹</span>. This is the message you should see each time you commit a working state of your project. If you get a different message, read it carefully; it’s likely you forgot to add a file before making a commit.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0008">Checking the Log</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Git keeps a log of all commits made to the project. Let’s check the log:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git log</b>
commit cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -&gt; main)
Author: eric &lt;eric@example.com&gt;
Date:   Mon Jun 6 19:37:26 2022 -0800

    Started project.
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>Each time you make a commit, Git generates a unique, 40-character reference ID. It records who made the commit, when it was made, and the message recorded. You won’t always need all of this information, so Git provides an option to print a simpler version of the log entries:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git log --pretty=oneline</b>
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -&gt; main) Started project.
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--pretty=oneline</code> flag provides the two most important pieces of information: the reference ID of the commit and the message recorded for the commit.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0009">The Second Commit</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">To see the real power of version control, we need to make a change to the project and commit that change. Here we’ll just add another line to <em>hello_git.py</em>:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>hello_git.py</b></p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">print("Hello Git world!")</span>
print("Hello everyone.")</code></pre>
<p>When we check the status of the project, we’ll see that Git has noticed the file that changed:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_488" title="488"></span><span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span>  modified:   hello_git.py

<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>We see the branch we’re working on <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>, the name of the file that was modified <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>, and that no changes have been committed <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>. Let’s commit the change and check the status again:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> git_practice$ <b>git commit -am "Extended greeting."</b>
[main 945fa13] Extended greeting.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> git_practice$ <b>git log --pretty=oneline</b>
945fa13af128a266d0114eebb7a3276f7d58ecd2 (HEAD -&gt; main) Extended greeting.
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 Started project.
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>We make a new commit, passing the <code>-am</code> flags when we use the command <code>git commit</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. The <code>-a</code> flag tells Git to add all modified files in the repository to the current commit. (If you create any new files between commits, reissue the <code>git add .</code> command to include the new files in the repository.) The <code>-m</code> flag tells Git to record a message in the log for this commit.</p>
<p>When we check the project’s status, we see that we once again have a clean working tree <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. Finally, we see the two commits in the log <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0010">Abandoning Changes</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Now let’s look at how to abandon a change and go back to the previous working state. First, add a new line to <em>hello_git.py</em>:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>hello_git.py</b></p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">print("Hello Git world!")</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print("Hello everyone.")</span>

print("Oh no, I broke the project!")</code></pre>
<p>Save and run this file.</p>
<p>We check the status and see that Git notices this change:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span>     modified:   hello_git.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_489" title="489"></span>Git sees that we modified <em>hello_git.py</em> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>, and we can commit the change if we want to. But this time, instead of committing the change, we’ll go back to the last commit when we knew our project was working. We won’t do anything to <em>hello_git.py</em>: we won’t delete the line or use the Undo feature in the text editor. Instead, enter the following commands in your terminal session:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git restore .</b>
git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>git restore </code><var>filename</var> allows you to abandon all changes since the last commit in a specific file. The command <code>git restore .</code> abandons all changes made in all files since the last commit; this action restores the project to the last committed state.</p>
<p>When you return to your text editor, you’ll see that <em>hello_git.py</em> has changed back to this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">print("Hello Git world!")</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print("Hello everyone.")</span></code></pre>
<p>Although going back to a previous state might seem trivial in this simple project, if we were working on a large project with dozens of modified files, all the files that had changed since the last commit would be restored. This feature is incredibly useful: you can make as many changes as you want when implementing a new feature, and if they don’t work, you can discard them without affecting the project. You don’t have to remember those changes and manually undo them. Git does all of that for you.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0011">Checking Out Previous Commits</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can revisit any commit in your log, using the <code>checkout</code> command, by using the first six characters of a reference ID. After checking out and reviewing an earlier commit, you can return to the latest commit or abandon your recent work and pick up development from the earlier commit:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git log --pretty=oneline</b>
945fa13af128a266d0114eebb7a3276f7d58ecd2 (HEAD -&gt; main) Extended greeting.
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 Started project.
git_practice$ <b>git checkout cea13d</b>
Note: switching to 'cea13d'.

<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_490" title="490"></span>If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at cea13d Started project.
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>When you check out a previous commit, you leave the main branch and enter what Git refers to as a <em>detached HEAD</em> state <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. <em>HEAD</em> is the current committed state of the project; you’re <em>detached</em> because you’ve left a named branch (<code>main</code>, in this case).</p>
<p>To get back to the <code>main</code> branch, you follow the suggestion <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span> to undo the previous operation:</p>
<pre><code>git_practice$ <b>git switch -</b>
Previous HEAD position was cea13d Started project.
Switched to branch 'main'
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>This command brings you back to the <code>main</code> branch. Unless you want to work with some more advanced features of Git, it’s best not to make any changes to your project when you’ve checked out a previous commit. However, if you’re the only one working on a project and you want to discard all of the more recent commits and go back to a previous state, you can reset the project to a previous commit. Working from the <code>main</code> branch, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working directory clean
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> git_practice$ <b>git log --pretty=oneline</b>

<span aria-label="annotation5" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❺</span> git_practice$ <b>git log --pretty=oneline</b>
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -&gt; main) Started project.
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>We first check the status to make sure we’re on the <code>main</code> branch <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. When we look at the log, we see both commits <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. We then issue the <code>git reset --hard</code> command with the first six characters of the reference ID of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_491" title="491"></span>the commit we want to go back to permanently <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>. We check the status again and see we’re on the <code>main</code> branch with nothing to commit <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">❹</span>. When we look at the log again, we see that we’re at the commit we wanted to start over from <span aria-label="annotation5" class="CodeAnnotation">❺</span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b04-0012">Deleting the Repository</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Sometimes you’ll mess up your repository’s history and won’t know how to recover it. If this happens, first consider asking for help using the approaches discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix C">Appendix C</span>. If you can’t fix it and you’re working on a solo project, you can continue working with the files but get rid of the project’s history by deleting the <em>.git</em> directory. This won’t affect the current state of any of the files, but it will delete all commits, so you won’t be able to check out any other states of the project.</p>
<p>To do this, either open a file browser and delete the <em>.git</em> repository or delete it from the command line. Afterward, you’ll need to start over with a fresh repository to start tracking your changes again. Here’s what this entire process looks like in a terminal session:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working directory clean
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> git_practice$ <b>rm -rf .git/</b>

<span aria-label="annotation5" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❺</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
      .gitignore
      hello_git.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
<span aria-label="annotation6" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❻</span> git_practice$ <b>git add .</b>
git_practice$ <b>git commit -m "Starting over."</b>
[main (root-commit) 14ed9db] Starting over.
 2 files changed, 5 insertions(+)

 create mode 100644 hello_git.py
<span aria-label="annotation7" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❼</span> git_practice$ <b>git status</b>
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
git_practice$</code></pre>
<p>We first check the status and see that we have a clean working directory <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. Then we use the command <code>rm -rf .git/</code> to delete the <em>.git</em> directory (<code>del .git</code> on Windows) <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. When we check the status after deleting the <em>.git</em> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_492" title="492"></span>folder, we’re told that this is not a Git repository <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>. All the information Git uses to track a repository is stored in the <em>.git</em> folder, so removing it deletes the entire repository.</p>
<p>We’re then free to use <code>git init</code> to start a fresh repository <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">❹</span>. Checking the status shows that we’re back at the initial stage, awaiting the first commit <span aria-label="annotation5" class="CodeAnnotation">❺</span>. We add the files and make the first commit <span aria-label="annotation6" class="CodeAnnotation">❻</span>. Checking the status now shows us that we’re on the new <code>main</code> branch with nothing to commit <span aria-label="annotation7" class="CodeAnnotation">❼</span>.</p>
<p>Using version control takes a bit of practice, but once you start using it, you’ll never want to work without it again.</p>
