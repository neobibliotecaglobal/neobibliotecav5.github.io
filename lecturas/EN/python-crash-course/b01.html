<p class="ChapterIntro">There are many versions of Python available and numerous ways to set it up on each operating system. If the approach in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span> didn’t work, or if you want to install a different version of Python than the one currently installed, the instructions in this appendix can help.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b01-0001">Python on Windows</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The instructions in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span> show you how to install Python using the official installer at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>. If you couldn’t get Python to run after using the installer, the troubleshooting instructions in this section should help you get Python up and running.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0001">Using py Instead of python</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you run a recent Python installer and then issue the command <code class="bold">python</code> in a terminal, you should see the Python prompt for a terminal session (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_464" title="464"></span>When Windows doesn’t recognize the <code>python</code> command, it will either open the Microsoft Store because it thinks Python isn’t installed, or you’ll get a message such as “Python was not found.” If the Microsoft Store opens, close it; it’s better to use the official Python installer from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a> than the one that Microsoft maintains.</p>
<p>The simplest solution, without making any changes to your system, is to try the <code class="bold">py</code> command. This is a Windows utility that finds the latest version of Python installed on your system and runs that interpreter. If this command works and you want to use it, simply use <code class="bold">py</code> anywhere you see the <code>python</code> or <code>python3</code> command in this book.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0002">Rerunning the Installer</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The most common reason <code>python</code> doesn’t work is that people forget to select the Add Python to PATH option when running the installer; this is an easy mistake to make. The <code>PATH</code> variable is a system setting that tells Python where to look for commonly used programs. In this case, Windows doesn’t know how to find the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>The simplest fix in this situation is to run the installer again. If there’s a newer installer available from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>, download the new installer and run it, making sure to check the <b>Add Python to PATH</b> box.</p>
<p>If you already have the latest installer, run it again and select the <b>Modify</b> option. You’ll see a list of optional features; keep the default options selected on this screen. Then click <b>Next</b> and check the <b>Add Python to Environment Variables</b> box. Finally, click <b>Install</b>. The installer will recognize that Python is already installed, and it will add the location of the Python interpreter to the <code>PATH</code> variable. Make sure you close any open terminals, because they’ll still be using the old <code>PATH</code> variable. Open a new terminal window and issue the command <code class="bold">python</code> again; you should see a Python prompt (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b01-0002">Python on macOS</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The installation instructions in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span> use the official Python installer at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>. The official installer has been working well for years now, but there are a few things that can get you off track. This section will help if anything isn’t working in a straightforward manner.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0003">Accidentally Installing Apple’s Version of Python</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you run the <code>python3</code> command and Python is not yet installed on your system, you’ll most likely see a message that the <em>command line developer tools</em> need to be installed. The best approach at this point is to close the pop-up showing this message, download the Python installer from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>, and run the installer.</p>
<p>If you choose to install the command line developer tools at this point, macOS will install Apple’s version of Python along with the developer tools. The only issue with this is that Apple’s version of Python is usually somewhat behind the latest official version of Python. However, you can still download and run the official installer from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>, and <code>python3</code> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_465" title="465"></span>will then point to the newer version. Don’t worry about having the developer tools installed; there are some useful tools in there, including the Git version control system discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix D">Appendix D</span>.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0004">Python 2 on Older Versions of macOS</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">On older versions of macOS, before Monterey (macOS 12), an outdated version of Python 2 was installed by default. On these systems, the command <code>python</code> points to the outdated system interpreter. If you’re using a version of macOS with Python 2 installed, make sure you use the <code class="bold">python3</code> command, and you’ll always be using the version of Python you installed.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b01-0003">Python on Linux</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Python is included by default on almost every Linux system. However, if the default version on your system is earlier than Python 3.9, you should install the latest version. You can also install the latest version if you want the most recent features, like Python’s improved error messages. The following instructions should work for most apt-based systems.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0005">Using the Default Python Installation</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you want to use the version of Python that <code>python3</code> points to, make sure you have these three additional packages installed:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv</b></code></pre>
<p>These packages include tools that are useful for developers and tools that let you install third-party packages, like the ones used in the projects section of this book.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0006">Installing the Latest Version of Python</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">We’ll use a package called <code>deadsnakes</code>, which makes it easy to install multiple versions of Python. Enter the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa</b>
$ <b>sudo apt update</b>
$ <b>sudo apt install python3.11</b></code></pre>
<p>These commands will install Python 3.11 onto your system.</p>
<p>Enter the following command to start a terminal session that runs Python 3.11:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>python3.11</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Anywhere you see the command <code>python</code> in this book, use <code class="bold">python3.11</code> instead. You’ll also want to use this command when you run programs from the terminal.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_466" title="466"></span>You’ll need to install two more packages to make the most of your Python installation:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>sudo apt install python3.11-dev python3.11-venv</b></code></pre>
<p>These packages include modules you’ll need when installing and running third-party packages, like the ones used in the projects in the second half of the book.</p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>
<p>	The <code>deadsnakes</code> package has been actively maintained for a long time. When newer versions of Python come out, you can use these same commands, replacing <code>python3.11</code> with the latest version currently available.</p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>

<h2 id="h1-502703b01-0004">Checking Which Version of Python You’re Using</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you’re having any issues running Python or installing additional packages, it can be helpful to know exactly which version of Python you’re using. You may have multiple versions of Python installed and not be clear about which version is currently being used.</p>
<p>Issue the following command in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>python --version</b>
Python 3.11.0</code></pre>
<p>This tells you exactly which version the command <code>python</code> is currently pointing to. The shorter command <code>python -V</code> will give the same output.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703b01-0005">Python Keywords and Built-in Functions</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Python comes with its own set of keywords and built-in functions. It’s important to be aware of these when you’re naming things in Python: your names cannot be the same as these keywords and shouldn’t be the same as the function names, or you’ll overwrite the functions.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll list Python’s keywords and built-in function names, so you’ll know which names to avoid.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0007">Python Keywords</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Each of the following keywords has a specific meaning, and you’ll see an error if you try to use any of them as a variable name.</p>
<pre><code>False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield</code></pre>
<h3 id="h2-502703b01-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_467" title="467"></span>Python Built-in Functions</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You won’t get an error if you use one of the following readily available built-in functions as a variable name, but you’ll override the behavior of that function:</p>
<pre><code>abs()           hash()            slice()
aiter()         help()            sorted()
all()           hex()             staticmethod()
any()           id()              str()
anext()         input()           sum()
ascii()         int()             super()
bin()           isinstance()      tuple()
bool()          issubclass()      type()
breakpoint()    iter()            vars()
bytearray()     len()             zip()
bytes()         list()            __import__()
callable()      locals()
chr()           map()
classmethod()   max()
compile()       memoryview()
complex()       min()
delattr()       next()
dict()          object()
dir()           oct()
divmod()        open()
enumerate()     ord()
eval()          pow()
exec()          print()
filter()        property()
float()         range()
format()        repr()
frozenset()     reversed()
getattr()       round()
globals()       set()
hasattr()       setattr()</code></pre>
