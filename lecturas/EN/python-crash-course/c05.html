<p class="ChapterIntro">Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python’s <code>if</code> statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you to check any condition of interest. You’ll learn to write simple <code>if</code> statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of <code>if</code> statements to identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a <code>for</code> loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a different way.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703c05-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_72" title="72"></span>A Simple Example</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The following example shows how <code>if</code> tests let you respond to special situations correctly. Imagine you have a list of cars and you want to print out the name of each car. Car names are proper names, so the names of most cars should be printed in title case. However, the value <code>'bmw'</code> should be printed in all uppercase. The following code loops through a list of car names and looks for the value <code>'bmw'</code>. Whenever the value is <code>'bmw'</code>, it’s printed in uppercase instead of title case:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>cars.py</b></p>
<pre><code>cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

for car in cars:
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span>     if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())
    else:
        print(car.title())</code></pre>
<p>The loop in this example first checks if the current value of <code>car</code> is <code>'bmw'</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. If it is, the value is printed in uppercase. If the value of <code>car</code> is anything other than <code>'bmw'</code>, it’s printed in title case:</p>
<pre><code>Audi
BMW
Subaru
Toyota</code></pre>
<p>This example combines a number of the concepts you’ll learn about in this chapter. Let’s begin by looking at the kinds of tests you can use to examine the conditions in your program.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703c05-0002">Conditional Tests</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">At the heart of every <code>if</code> statement is an expression that can be evaluated as <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> and is called a <em>conditional test</em>. Python uses the values <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> to decide whether the code in an <code>if</code> statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to <code>True</code>, Python executes the code following the <code>if</code> statement. If the test evaluates to <code>False</code>, Python ignores the code following the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0001">Checking for Equality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most conditional tests compare the current value of a variable to a specific value of interest. The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a variable is equal to the value of interest:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car = 'bmw'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car == 'bmw'</b>
True</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_73" title="73"></span>The first line sets the value of <code>car</code> to <code>'bmw'</code> using a single equal sign, as you’ve seen many times already. The next line checks whether the value of <code>car</code> is <code>'bmw'</code> by using a double equal sign (<code>==</code>). This <em>equality operator</em> returns <code>True</code> if the values on the left and right side of the operator match, and <code>False</code> if they don’t match. The values in this example match, so Python returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>When the value of <code>car</code> is anything other than <code>'bmw'</code>, this test returns <code>False</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car = 'audi'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car == 'bmw'</b>
False</code></pre>
<p>A single equal sign is really a statement; you might read the first line of code here as “Set the value of <code>car</code> equal to <code>'audi'</code>.” On the other hand, a double equal sign asks a question: “Is the value of <code>car</code> equal to <code>'bmw'</code>?” Most programming languages use equal signs in this way.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0002">Ignoring Case When Checking for Equality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Testing for equality is case sensitive in Python. For example, two values with different capitalization are not considered equal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car = 'Audi'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car == 'audi'</b>
False</code></pre>
<p>If case matters, this behavior is advantageous. But if case doesn’t matter and instead you just want to test the value of a variable, you can convert the variable’s value to lowercase before doing the comparison:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car = 'Audi'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car.lower() == 'audi'</b>
True</code></pre>
<p>This test will return <code>True</code> no matter how the value <code>'Audi'</code> is formatted because the test is now case insensitive. The <code>lower()</code> method doesn’t change the value that was originally stored in <code>car</code>, so you can do this kind of comparison without affecting the original variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car = 'Audi'</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car.lower() == 'audi'</b>
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>car</b>
'Audi'</code></pre>
<p>We first assign the capitalized string <code>'Audi'</code> to the variable <code>car</code>. Then, we convert the value of <code>car</code> to lowercase and compare the lowercase value to the string <code>'audi'</code>. The two strings match, so Python returns <code>True</code>. We can see that the value stored in <code>car</code> has not been affected by the <code>lower()</code> method.</p>
<p>Websites enforce certain rules for the data that users enter in a manner similar to this. For example, a site might use a conditional test like this to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_74" title="74"></span>ensure that every user has a truly unique username, not just a variation on the capitalization of another person’s username. When someone submits a new username, that new username is converted to lowercase and compared to the lowercase versions of all existing usernames. During this check, a username like <code>'John'</code> will be rejected if any variation of <code>'john'</code> is already in use.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0003">Checking for Inequality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">When you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can use the <em>inequality operator</em> (<code>!=</code>). Let’s use another <code>if</code> statement to examine how to use the inequality operator. We’ll store a requested pizza topping in a variable and then print a message if the person did not order anchovies:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>toppings.py</b></p>
<pre><code>requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
    print("Hold the anchovies!")</code></pre>
<p>This code compares the value of <code>requested_topping</code> to the value <code>'anchovies'</code>. If these two values do not match, Python returns <code>True</code> and executes the code following the <code>if</code> statement. If the two values match, Python returns <code>False</code> and does not run the code following the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>Because the value of <code>requested_topping</code> is not <code>'anchovies'</code>, the <code>print()</code> function is executed:</p>
<pre><code>Hold the anchovies!</code></pre>
<p>Most of the conditional expressions you write will test for equality, but sometimes you’ll find it more efficient to test for inequality.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0004">Numerical Comparisons</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Testing numerical values is pretty straightforward. For example, the following code checks whether a person is 18 years old:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age = 18</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age == 18</b>
True</code></pre>
<p>You can also test to see if two numbers are not equal. For example, the following code prints a message if the given answer is not correct:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>magic_number.py</b></p>
<pre><code>answer = 17
if answer != 42:
    print("That is not the correct answer. Please try again!")</code></pre>
<p>The conditional test passes, because the value of <code>answer</code> (<code>17</code>) is not equal to <code>42</code>. Because the test passes, the indented code block is executed:</p>
<pre><code>That is not the correct answer. Please try again!</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_75" title="75"></span>You can include various mathematical comparisons in your conditional statements as well, such as less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and greater than or equal to:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age = 19</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age &lt; 21</b>
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age &lt;= 21</b>
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age &gt; 21</b>
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age &gt;= 21</b>
False</code></pre>
<p>Each mathematical comparison can be used as part of an <code>if</code> statement, which can help you detect the exact conditions of interest.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0005">Checking Multiple Conditions</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You may want to check multiple conditions at the same time. For example, sometimes you might need two conditions to be <code>True</code> to take an action. Other times, you might be satisfied with just one condition being <code>True</code>. The keywords <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> can help you in these situations.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c05-0001">Using and to Check Multiple Conditions</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">To check whether two conditions are both <code>True</code> simultaneously, use the keyword <code>and</code> to combine the two conditional tests; if each test passes, the overall expression evaluates to <code>True</code>. If either test fails or if both tests fail, the expression evaluates to <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>For example, you can check whether two people are both over 21 by using the following test:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 = 22</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_1 = 18</b>
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 &gt;= 21 and age_1 &gt;= 21</b>
False
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_1 = 22</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 &gt;= 21 and age_1 &gt;= 21</b>
True</code></pre>
<p>First, we define two ages, <code>age_0</code> and <code>age_1</code>. Then we check whether both ages are 21 or older <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. The test on the left passes, but the test on the right fails, so the overall conditional expression evaluates to <code>False</code>. We then change <code>age_1</code> to 22 <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. The value of <code>age_1</code> is now greater than 21, so both individual tests pass, causing the overall conditional expression to evaluate as <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>To improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual tests, but they are not required. If you use parentheses, your test would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>(age_0 &gt;= 21) and (age_1 &gt;= 21)</code></pre>
<h4 id="h3-502703c05-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_76" title="76"></span>Using or to Check Multiple Conditions</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">The keyword <code>or</code> allows you to check multiple conditions as well, but it passes when either or both of the individual tests pass. An <code>or</code> expression fails only when both individual tests fail.</p>
<p>Let’s consider two ages again, but this time we’ll look for only one person to be over 21:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 = 22</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_1 = 18</b>
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 &gt;= 21 or age_1 &gt;= 21</b>
True
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 = 18</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>age_0 &gt;= 21 or age_1 &gt;= 21</b>
False</code></pre>
<p>We start with two age variables again. Because the test for <code>age_0</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> passes, the overall expression evaluates to <code>True</code>. We then lower <code>age_0</code> to 18. In the final test <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>, both tests now fail and the overall expression evaluates to <code>False</code>.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0006">Checking Whether a Value Is in a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Sometimes it’s important to check whether a list contains a certain value before taking an action. For example, you might want to check whether a new username already exists in a list of current usernames before completing someone’s registration on a website. In a mapping project, you might want to check whether a submitted location already exists in a list of known locations.</p>
<p>To find out whether a particular value is already in a list, use the keyword <code>in</code>. Let’s consider some code you might write for a pizzeria. We’ll make a list of toppings a customer has requested for a pizza and then check whether certain toppings are in the list.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>'mushrooms' in requested_toppings</b>
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>'pepperoni' in requested_toppings</b>
False</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>in</code> tells Python to check for the existence of <code>'mushrooms'</code> and <code>'pepperoni'</code> in the list <code>requested_toppings</code>. This technique is quite powerful because you can create a list of essential values, and then easily check whether the value you’re testing matches one of the values in the list.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0007">Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Other times, it’s important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You can use the keyword <code>not</code> in this situation. For example, consider a list of users who are banned from commenting in a forum. You can check whether a user has been banned before allowing that person to submit a comment:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>banned_users.py</b></p>
<pre><code>banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']
user = 'marie'

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_77" title="77"></span>if user not in banned_users:
    print(f"{user.title()}, you can post a response if you wish.")</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement here reads quite clearly. If the value of <code>user</code> is not in the list <code>banned_users</code>, Python returns <code>True</code> and executes the indented line.</p>
<p>The user <code>'marie'</code> is not in the list <code>banned_users</code>, so she sees a message inviting her to post a response:</p>
<pre><code>Marie, you can post a response if you wish.</code></pre>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0008">Boolean Expressions</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">As you learn more about programming, you’ll hear the term <em>Boolean expression</em> at some point. A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional test. A <em>Boolean value</em> is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, just like the value of a conditional expression after it has been evaluated.</p>
<p>Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on a website:</p>
<pre><code>game_active = True
can_edit = False</code></pre>
<p>Boolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program or a particular condition that is important in your program.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502703c05-0003">if Statements</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When you understand conditional tests, you can start writing <code>if</code> statements. Several different kinds of <code>if</code> statements exist, and your choice of which to use depends on the number of conditions you need to test. You saw several examples of <code>if</code> statements in the discussion about conditional tests, but now let’s dig deeper into the topic.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0009">Simple if Statements</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The simplest kind of <code>if</code> statement has one test and one action:</p>
<pre><code>if <var>conditional_test</var>:
    <var>do something</var></code></pre>
<p>You can put any conditional test in the first line and just about any action in the indented block following the test. If the conditional test evaluates to <code>True</code>, Python executes the code following the <code>if</code> statement. If the test evaluates to <code>False</code>, Python ignores the code following the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a variable representing a person’s age, and we want to know if that person is old enough to vote. The following code tests whether the person can vote:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>voting.py</b></p>
<pre><code>age = 19
if age &gt;= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote!")</code></pre>
<p>Python checks to see whether the value of <code>age</code> is greater than or equal to 18. It is, so Python executes the indented <code>print()</code> call:</p>
<pre><code>You are old enough to vote!</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_79" title="79"></span>Indentation plays the same role in <code>if</code> statements as it did in <code>for</code> loops. All indented lines after an <code>if</code> statement will be executed if the test passes, and the entire block of indented lines will be ignored if the test does not pass.</p>
<p>You can have as many lines of code as you want in the block following the <code>if</code> statement. Let’s add another line of output if the person is old enough to vote, asking if the individual has registered to vote yet:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">age = 19</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">if age &gt;= 18:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    print("You are old enough to vote!")</span>
    print("Have you registered to vote yet?")</code></pre>
<p>The conditional test passes, and both <code>print()</code> calls are indented, so both lines are printed:</p>
<pre><code>You are old enough to vote!
Have you registered to vote yet?</code></pre>
<p>If the value of <code>age</code> is less than 18, this program would produce no output.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0010">if-else Statements</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Often, you’ll want to take one action when a conditional test passes and a different action in all other cases. Python’s <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> syntax makes this possible. An <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> block is similar to a simple <code>if</code> statement, but the <code>else</code> statement allows you to define an action or set of actions that are executed when the conditional test fails.</p>
<p>We’ll display the same message we had previously if the person is old enough to vote, but this time we’ll add a message for anyone who is not old enough to vote:</p>
<pre><code>age = 17
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> <span class="LiteralGray">if age &gt;= 18:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    print("You are old enough to vote!")</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    print("Have you registered to vote yet?")</span>
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> else:
    print("Sorry, you are too young to vote.")
    print("Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!")</code></pre>
<p>If the conditional test <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> passes, the first block of indented <code>print()</code> calls is executed. If the test evaluates to <code>False</code>, the <code>else</code> block <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span> is executed. Because <code>age</code> is less than 18 this time, the conditional test fails and the code in the <code>else</code> block is executed:</p>
<pre><code>Sorry, you are too young to vote.
Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!</code></pre>
<p>This code works because it has only two possible situations to evaluate: a person is either old enough to vote or not old enough to vote. The <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_80" title="80"></span>structure works well in situations in which you want Python to always execute one of two possible actions. In a simple <code>if-else</code> chain like this, one of the two actions will always be executed.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0011">The if-elif-else Chain</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Often, you’ll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate these you can use Python’s <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> syntax. Python executes only one block in an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and Python skips the rest of the tests.</p>
<p>Many real-world situations involve more than two possible conditions. For example, consider an amusement park that charges different rates for different age groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admission for anyone under age 4 is free.</li>
<li>Admission for anyone between the ages of 4 and 18 is $25.</li>
<li>Admission for anyone age 18 or older is $40.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we use an <code>if</code> statement to determine a person’s admission rate? The following code tests for the age group of a person and then prints an admission price message:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>amusement_park.py</b></p>
<pre><code>age = 12
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> if age &lt; 4:
    print("Your admission cost is $0.")
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> elif age &lt; 18:
    print("Your admission cost is $25.")
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> else:
    print("Your admission cost is $40.")</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> test <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> checks whether a person is under 4 years old. When the test passes, an appropriate message is printed and Python skips the rest of the tests. The <code>elif</code> line <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span> is really another <code>if</code> test, which runs only if the previous test failed. At this point in the chain, we know the person is at least 4 years old because the first test failed. If the person is under 18, an appropriate message is printed and Python skips the <code>else</code> block. If both the <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code> tests fail, Python runs the code in the <code>else</code> block <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>.</p>
<p>In this example the <code>if</code> test <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> evaluates to <code>False</code>, so its code block is not executed. However, the <code>elif</code> test evaluates to <code>True</code> (12 is less than 18) so its code is executed. The output is one sentence, informing the user of the admission cost:</p>
<pre><code>Your admission cost is $25.</code></pre>
<p>Any age greater than 17 would cause the first two tests to fail. In these situations, the <code>else</code> block would be executed and the admission price would be $40.</p>
<p>Rather than printing the admission price within the <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> block, it would be more concise to set just the price inside the <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_81" title="81"></span>and then have a single <code>print()</code> call that runs after the chain has been evaluated:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">age = 12</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">if age &lt; 4:</span>
    price = 0
<span class="LiteralGray">elif age &lt; 18:</span>
    price = 25
<span class="LiteralGray">else:</span>
    price = 40

print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")</code></pre>
<p>The indented lines set the value of <code>price</code> according to the person’s age, as in the previous example. After the price is set by the <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain, a separate unindented <code>print()</code> call uses this value to display a message reporting the person’s admission price.</p>
<p>This code produces the same output as the previous example, but the purpose of the <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain is narrower. Instead of determining a price and displaying a message, it simply determines the admission price. In addition to being more efficient, this revised code is easier to modify than the original approach. To change the text of the output message, you would need to change only one <code>print()</code> call rather than three separate <code>print()</code> calls.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0012">Using Multiple elif Blocks</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can use as many <code>elif</code> blocks in your code as you like. For example, if the amusement park were to implement a discount for seniors, you could add one more conditional test to the code to determine whether someone qualifies for the senior discount. Let’s say that anyone 65 or older pays half the regular admission, or $20:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">age = 12</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">if age &lt; 4:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    price = 0</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">elif age &lt; 18:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    price = 25</span>
elif age &lt; 65:
    price = 40
else:
    price = 20

<span class="LiteralGray">print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")</span></code></pre>
<p>Most of this code is unchanged. The second <code>elif</code> block now checks to make sure a person is less than age 65 before assigning them the full admission rate of $40. Notice that the value assigned in the <code>else</code> block needs to be changed to $20, because the only ages that make it to this block are for people 65 or older.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0013"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_82" title="82"></span>Omitting the else Block</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Python does not require an <code>else</code> block at the end of an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code> chain. Sometimes, an <code>else</code> block is useful. Other times, it’s clearer to use an additional <code>elif</code> statement that catches the specific condition of interest:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">age = 12</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">if age &lt; 4:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    price = 0</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">elif age &lt; 18:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    price = 25</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">elif age &lt; 65:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    price = 40</span>
elif age &gt;= 65:
    <span class="LiteralGray">price = 20</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")</span></code></pre>
<p>The final <code>elif</code> block assigns a price of $20 when the person is 65 or older, which is a little clearer than the general <code>else</code> block. With this change, every block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed.</p>
<p>The <code>else</code> block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that wasn’t matched by a specific <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code> test, and that can sometimes include invalid or even malicious data. If you have a specific final condition you’re testing for, consider using a final <code>elif</code> block and omit the <code>else</code> block. As a result, you’ll be more confident that your code will run only under the correct conditions.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0014">Testing Multiple Conditions</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain is powerful, but it’s only appropriate to use when you just need one test to pass. As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it skips the rest of the tests. This behavior is beneficial, because it’s efficient and allows you to test for one specific condition.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it’s important to check all conditions of interest. In this case, you should use a series of simple <code>if</code> statements with no <code>elif</code> or <code>else</code> blocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could be <code>True</code>, and you want to act on every condition that is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s reconsider the pizzeria example. If someone requests a two-topping pizza, you’ll need to be sure to include both toppings on their pizza:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>toppings.py</b></p>
<pre><code>requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']

if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding mushrooms.")
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> if 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding pepperoni.")
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_83" title="83"></span>if 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:
    print("Adding extra cheese.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</code></pre>
<p>We start with a list containing the requested toppings. The first <code>if</code> statement checks to see whether the person requested mushrooms on their pizza. If so, a message is printed confirming that topping. The test for pepperoni <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> is another simple <code>if</code> statement, not an <code>elif</code> or <code>else</code> statement, so this test is run regardless of whether the previous test passed or not. The last <code>if</code> statement checks whether extra cheese was requested, regardless of the results from the first two tests. These three independent tests are executed every time this program is run.</p>
<p>Because every condition in this example is evaluated, both mushrooms and extra cheese are added to the pizza:</p>
<pre><code>Adding mushrooms.
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!</code></pre>
<p>This code would not work properly if we used an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> block, because the code would stop running after only one test passes. Here’s what that would look like:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    print("Adding mushrooms.")</span>
elif 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:
    <span class="LiteralGray">print("Adding pepperoni.")</span>
elif 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:
   <span class="LiteralGray"> print("Adding extra cheese.")</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</span></code></pre>
<p>The test for <code>'mushrooms'</code> is the first test to pass, so mushrooms are added to the pizza. However, the values <code>'extra cheese'</code> and <code>'pepperoni'</code> are never checked, because Python doesn’t run any tests beyond the first test that passes in an <code>if-elif-else</code> chain. The customer’s first topping will be added, but all of their other toppings will be missed:</p>
<pre><code>Adding mushrooms.

Finished making your pizza!</code></pre>
<p>In summary, if you want only one block of code to run, use an <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chain. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of independent <code>if</code> statements.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502703c05-0004">Using if Statements with Lists</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can do some interesting work when you combine lists and <code>if</code> statements. You can watch for special values that need to be treated differently than other values in the list. You can efficiently manage changing conditions, such as the availability of certain items in a restaurant throughout a shift. You can also begin to prove that your code works as you expect it to in all possible situations.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0015">Checking for Special Items</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">This chapter began with a simple example that showed how to handle a special value like <code>'bmw'</code>, which needed to be printed in a different format than other values in the list. Now that you have a basic understanding of conditional tests and <code>if</code> statements, let’s take a closer look at how you can watch for special values in a list and handle those values appropriately.</p>
<p>Let’s continue with the pizzeria example. The pizzeria displays a message whenever a topping is added to your pizza, as it’s being made. The code for this action can be written very efficiently by making a list of toppings the customer has requested and using a loop to announce each topping as it’s added to the pizza:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>toppings.py</b></p>
<pre><code>requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
    print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</code></pre>
<p>The output is straightforward because this code is just a simple <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>Adding mushrooms.
Adding green peppers.
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_86" title="86"></span>But what if the pizzeria runs out of green peppers? An <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>for</code> loop can handle this situation appropriately:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">for requested_topping in requested_toppings:</span>
    if requested_topping == 'green peppers':
        print("Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.")
    else:
       <span class="LiteralGray"> print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")</span>

<span class="LiteralGray">print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</span></code></pre>
<p>This time, we check each requested item before adding it to the pizza. The <code>if</code> statement checks to see if the person requested green peppers. If so, we display a message informing them why they can’t have green peppers. The <code>else</code> block ensures that all other toppings will be added to the pizza.</p>
<p>The output shows that each requested topping is handled appropriately.</p>
<pre><code>Adding mushrooms.
Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!</code></pre>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0016">Checking That a List Is Not Empty</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">We’ve made a simple assumption about every list we’ve worked with so far: we’ve assumed that each list has at least one item in it. Soon we’ll let users provide the information that’s stored in a list, so we won’t be able to assume that a list has any items in it each time a loop is run. In this situation, it’s useful to check whether a list is empty before running a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s check whether the list of requested toppings is empty before building the pizza. If the list is empty, we’ll prompt the user and make sure they want a plain pizza. If the list is not empty, we’ll build the pizza just as we did in the previous examples:</p>
<pre><code>requested_toppings = []

if requested_toppings:
    <span class="LiteralGray">for requested_topping in requested_toppings:</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">        print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">    print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</span>
else:
    print("Are you sure you want a plain pizza?")</code></pre>
<p>This time we start out with an empty list of requested toppings. Instead of jumping right into a <code>for</code> loop, we do a quick check first. When the name of a list is used in an <code>if</code> statement, Python returns <code>True</code> if the list contains at least one item; an empty list evaluates to <code>False</code>. If <code>requested_toppings</code> passes the conditional test, we run the same <code>for</code> loop we used in the previous <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_87" title="87"></span>example. If the conditional test fails, we print a message asking the customer if they really want a plain pizza with no toppings.</p>
<p>The list is empty in this case, so the output asks if the user really wants a plain pizza:</p>
<pre><code>Are you sure you want a plain pizza?</code></pre>
<p>If the list is not empty, the output will show each requested topping being added to the pizza.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c05-0017">Using Multiple Lists</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">People will ask for just about anything, especially when it comes to pizza toppings. What if a customer actually wants french fries on their pizza? You can use lists and <code>if</code> statements to make sure your input makes sense before you act on it.</p>
<p>Let’s watch out for unusual topping requests before we build a pizza. The following example defines two lists. The first is a list of available toppings at the pizzeria, and the second is the list of toppings that the user has requested. This time, each item in <code>requested_toppings</code> is checked against the list of available toppings before it’s added to the pizza:</p>
<pre><code>available_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'olives', 'green peppers',
                      'pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'extra cheese']

<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'french fries', 'extra cheese']

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span>     if requested_topping in available_toppings:
        print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span>     else:
        print(f"Sorry, we don't have {requested_topping}.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza!")</code></pre>
<p>First, we define a list of available toppings at this pizzeria. Note that this could be a tuple if the pizzeria has a stable selection of toppings. Then, we make a list of toppings that a customer has requested. There’s an unusual request for a topping in this example: <code>'french fries'</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. Next we loop through the list of requested toppings. Inside the loop, we check to see if each requested topping is actually in the list of available toppings <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. If it is, we add that topping to the pizza. If the requested topping is not in the list of available toppings, the <code>else</code> block will run <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>. The <code>else</code> block prints a message telling the user which toppings are unavailable.</p>
<p>This code syntax produces clean, informative output:</p>
<pre><code>Adding mushrooms.
Sorry, we don't have french fries.
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!</code></pre>

<h2 id="h1-502703c05-0006">Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. You learned to write simple <code>if</code> statements, <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> chains, and <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you need to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a <code>for</code> loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.</p>
<p>In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span> you’ll learn about Python’s dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You’ll learn how to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combination with lists and <code>if</code> statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations.</p>
