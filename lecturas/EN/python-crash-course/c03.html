<p class="ChapterIntro">In this chapter and the next you’ll learn what lists are and how to start working with the elements in a list. Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place, whether you have just a few items or millions of items. Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features readily accessible to new programmers, and they tie together many important concepts in programming.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502703c03-0001">What Is a List?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">A <em>list</em> is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0 to 9, or the names of all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_34" title="34"></span>a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as <code>letters</code>, <code>digits</code>, or <code>names</code>.</p>
<p>In Python, square brackets (<code>[]</code>) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that contains a few kinds of bicycles:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>bicycles.py</b></p>
<pre><code>bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)</code></pre>
<p>If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the list, including the square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</code></pre>
<p>Because this isn’t the output you want your users to see, let’s learn how to access the individual items in a list.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0001">Accessing Elements in a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or<em> index</em>, of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.</p>
<p>For example, let’s pull out the first bicycle in the list <code>bicycles</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</span>
print(bicycles[0])</code></pre>
<p>When we ask for a single item from a list, Python returns just that element without square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>trek</code></pre>
<p>This is the result you want your users to see: clean, neatly formatted output.</p>
<p>You can also use the string methods from <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span> on any element in this list. For example, you can format the element <code>'trek'</code> to look more presentable by using the <code>title()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</span>
print(bicycles[0].title())</code></pre>
<p>This example produces the same output as the preceding example, except <code>'Trek'</code> is capitalized.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0002">Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. This is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_35" title="35"></span>how the list operations are implemented at a lower level. If you’re receiving unexpected results, ask yourself if you’re making a simple but common off-by-one error.</p>
<p>The second item in a list has an index of 1. Using this counting system, you can get any element you want from a list by subtracting one from its position in the list. For instance, to access the fourth item in a list, you request the item at index 3.</p>
<p>The following asks for the bicycles at index <code>1</code> and index <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</span>
print(bicycles[1])
print(bicycles[3])</code></pre>
<p>This code returns the second and fourth bicycles in the list:</p>
<pre><code>cannondale
specialized</code></pre>
<p>Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If you ask for the item at index <code>-1</code>, Python always returns the last item in the list:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</span>
print(bicycles[-1])</code></pre>
<p>This code returns the value <code>'specialized'</code>. This syntax is quite useful, because you’ll often want to access the last items in a list without knowing exactly how long the list is. This convention extends to other negative index values as well. The index <code>-2</code> returns the second item from the end of the list, the index <code>-3</code> returns the third item from the end, and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0003">Using Individual Values from a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can use individual values from a list just as you would any other variable. For example, you can use f-strings to create a message based on a value from a list.</p>
<p>Let’s try pulling the first bicycle from the list and composing a message using that value:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']</span>
message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}."

print(message)</code></pre>
<p>We build a sentence using the value at <code>bicycles[0]</code> and assign it to the variable <code>message</code>. The output is a simple sentence about the first bicycle in the list:</p>
<pre><code>My first bicycle was a Trek.</code></pre>

<h2 id="h1-502703c03-0002">Modifying, Adding, and Removing Elements</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most lists you create will be <em>dynamic</em>, meaning you’ll build a list and then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course. For example, you might create a game in which a player has to shoot aliens out of the sky. You could store the initial set of aliens in a list and then remove an alien from the list each time one is shot down. Each time a new alien appears on the screen, you add it to the list. Your list of aliens will increase and decrease in length throughout the course of the game.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0004">Modifying Elements in a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing an element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.</p>
<p>For example, say we have a list of motorcycles and the first item in the list is <code>'honda'</code>. We can change the value of this first item after the list has been created:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>motorcycles.py</b></p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_37" title="37"></span>Here we define the list <code>motorcycles</code>, with <code>'honda'</code> as the first element. Then we change the value of the first item to <code>'ducati'</code>. The output shows that the first item has been changed, while the rest of the list stays the same:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p>You can change the value of any item in a list, not just the first item.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0005">Adding Elements to a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You might want to add a new element to a list for many reasons. For example, you might want to make new aliens appear in a game, add new data to a visualization, or add new registered users to a website you’ve built. Python provides several ways to add new data to existing lists.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0001">Appending Elements to the End of a List</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">The simplest way to add a new element to a list is to <em>append</em> the item to the list. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end of the list. Using the same list we had in the previous example, we’ll add the new element <code>'ducati'</code> to the end of the list:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span>

motorcycles.append('ducati')
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span></code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>append()</code> method adds <code>'ducati'</code> to the end of the list, without affecting any of the other elements in the list:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']</code></pre>
<p>The <code>append()</code> method makes it easy to build lists dynamically. For example, you can start with an empty list and then add items to the list using a series of <code>append()</code> calls. Using an empty list, let’s add the elements <code>'honda'</code>, <code>'yamaha'</code>, and <code>'suzuki'</code> to the list:</p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = []

motorcycles.append('honda')
motorcycles.append('yamaha')
motorcycles.append('suzuki')

<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span></code></pre>
<p>The resulting list looks exactly the same as the lists in the previous examples:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_38" title="38"></span>Building lists this way is very common, because you often won’t know the data your users want to store in a program until after the program is running. To put your users in control, start by defining an empty list that will hold the users’ values. Then append each new value provided to the list you just created.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0002">Inserting Elements into a List</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the <code>insert()</code> method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item:</p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, we insert the value <code>'ducati'</code> at the beginning of the list. The <code>insert()</code> method opens a space at position <code>0</code> and stores the value <code>'ducati'</code> at that location:</p>
<pre><code>['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p>This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0006">Removing Elements from a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Often, you’ll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list. For example, when a player shoots down an alien from the sky, you’ll most likely want to remove it from the list of active aliens. Or when a user decides to cancel their account on a web application you created, you’ll want to remove that user from the list of active users. You can remove an item according to its position in the list or according to its value.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0003">Removing an Item Using the del Statement</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the <code>del</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>
print(motorcycles)

del motorcycles[0]
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span></code></pre>
<p>Here we use the <code>del</code> statement to remove the first item, <code>'honda'</code>, from the list of motorcycles:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['yamaha', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_39" title="39"></span>You can remove an item from any position in a list using the <code>del</code> statement if you know its index. For example, here’s how to remove the second item, <code>'yamaha'</code>, from the list:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span>

del motorcycles[1]
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span></code></pre>
<p>The second motorcycle is deleted from the list:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p>In both examples, you can no longer access the value that was removed from the list after the <code>del</code> statement is used.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0004">Removing an Item Using the pop() Method</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Sometimes you’ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a list. For example, you might want to get the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> position of an alien that was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members and then add that user to a list of inactive members.</p>
<p>The <code>pop()</code> method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it. The term <em>pop</em> comes from thinking of a list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.</p>
<p>Let’s pop a motorcycle from the list of motorcycles:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> <span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span>

<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> <span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span>
<span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❹</span> print(popped_motorcycle)</code></pre>
<p>We start by defining and printing the list <code>motorcycles</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. Then we pop a value from the list, and assign that value to the variable <code>popped_motorcycle</code> <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. We print the list <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span> to show that a value has been removed from the list. Then we print the popped value <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">❹</span> to prove that we still have access to the value that was removed.</p>
<p>The output shows that the value <code>'suzuki'</code> was removed from the end of the list and is now assigned to the variable <code>popped_motorcycle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha']
suzuki</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_40" title="40"></span>How might this <code>pop()</code> method be useful? Imagine that the motorcycles in the list are stored in chronological order, according to when we owned them. If this is the case, we can use the <code>pop()</code> method to print a statement about the last motorcycle we bought:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>

last_owned = motorcycles.pop()
print(f"The last motorcycle I owned was a {last_owned.title()}.")</code></pre>
<p>The output is a simple sentence about the most recent motorcycle we owned:</p>
<pre><code>The last motorcycle I owned was a Suzuki.</code></pre>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0005">Popping Items from Any Position in a List</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can use <code>pop()</code> to remove an item from any position in a list by including the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>

first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
print(f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")</code></pre>
<p>We start by popping the first motorcycle in the list, and then we print a message about that motorcycle. The output is a simple sentence describing the first motorcycle I ever owned:</p>
<pre><code>The first motorcycle I owned was a Honda.</code></pre>
<p>Remember that each time you use <code>pop()</code>, the item you work with is no longer stored in the list.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether to use the <code>del</code> statement or the <code>pop()</code> method, here’s a simple way to decide: when you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the <code>del</code> statement; if you want to use an item as you remove it, use the <code>pop()</code> method.</p>
<h4 id="h3-502703c03-0006">Removing an Item by Value</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the <code>remove()</code> method.</p>
<p>For example, say we want to remove the value <code>'ducati'</code> from the list of motorcycles:</p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print(motorcycles)</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"></span>Here the <code>remove()</code> method tells Python to figure out where <code>'ducati'</code> appears in the list and remove that element:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>remove()</code> method to work with a value that’s being removed from a list. Let’s remove the value <code>'ducati'</code> and print a reason for removing it from the list:</p>
<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> <span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']</span>
<span class="LiteralGray">print(motorcycles)</span>

<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> too_expensive = 'ducati'
<span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❸</span> motorcycles.remove(too_expensive)
print(motorcycles)
<span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❹</span> print(f"\nA {too_expensive.title()} is too expensive for me.")</code></pre>
<p>After defining the list <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>, we assign the value <code>'ducati'</code> to a variable called <code>too_expensive</code> <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>. We then use this variable to tell Python which value to remove from the list <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">❸</span>. The value <code>'ducati'</code> has been removed from the list <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">❹</span> but is still accessible through the variable <code>too_expensive</code>, allowing us to print a statement about why we removed <code>'ducati'</code> from the list of motorcycles:</p>
<pre><code>['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

A Ducati is too expensive for me.</code></pre>

<p>	The <code>remove()</code> method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify.

<h2 id="h1-502703c03-0003">Organizing a List</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Often, your lists will be created in an unpredictable order, because you can’t always control the order in which your users provide their data. Although this is unavoidable in most circumstances, you’ll frequently want to present your information in a particular order. Sometimes you’ll want <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_43" title="43"></span>to preserve the original order of your list, and other times you’ll want to change the original order. Python provides a number of different ways to organize your lists, depending on the situation.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0007">Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Python’s <code>sort()</code> method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them alphabetically. To keep the task simple, let’s assume that all the values in the list are lowercase:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>cars.py</b></p>
<pre><code>cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sort()</code> method changes the order of the list permanently. The cars are now in alphabetical order, and we can never revert to the original order:</p>
<pre><code>['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']</code></pre>
<p>You can also sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order by passing the argument <code>reverse=True</code> to the <code>sort()</code> method. The following example sorts the list of cars in reverse-alphabetical order:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']</span>
cars.sort(reverse=True)
<span class="LiteralGray">print(cars)</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, the order of the list is permanently changed:</p>
<pre><code>['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']</code></pre>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0008">Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you can use the <code>sorted()</code> function. The <code>sorted()</code> function lets you display your list in a particular order, but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list.</p>
<p>Let’s try this function on the list of cars.</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']</span>

<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)

<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_44" title="44"></span>We first print the list in its original order <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> and then in alphabetical order <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>.

<p>Notice that the list still exists in its original order <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> after the <code>sorted()</code> function has been used. The <code>sorted()</code> function can also accept a <code>reverse=True</code> argument if you want to display a list in reverse-alphabetical order.</p>

<p>	Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in lowercase. There are several ways to interpret capital letters when determining a sort order, and specifying the exact order can be more complex than we want to deal with at this time. However, most approaches to sorting will build directly on what you learned in this section.</p>

<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0009">Printing a List in Reverse Order</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the <code>reverse()</code> method. If we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to when we owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-chronological order:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']</span>
print(cars)

cars.reverse()
print(cars)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>reverse()</code> doesn’t sort backward alphabetically; it simply reverses the order of the list:</p>
<pre><code>['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']</code></pre>
<p>The <code>reverse()</code> method changes the order of a list permanently, but you can revert to the original order anytime by applying <code>reverse()</code> to the same list a second time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502703c03-0010">Finding the Length of a List</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can quickly find the length of a list by using the <code>len()</code> function. The list in this example has four items, so its length is <code>4</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>len(cars)</b>
4</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_45" title="45"></span>You’ll find <code>len()</code> useful when you need to identify the number of aliens that still need to be shot down in a game, determine the amount of data you have to manage in a visualization, or figure out the number of registered users on a website, among other tasks.</p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>
<p>	Python counts the items in a list starting with one, so you shouldn’t run into any off-by-one errors when determining the length of a list.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502703c03-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_46" title="46"></span>Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There’s one type of error that’s common to see when you’re working with lists for the first time. Let’s say you have a list with three items, and you ask for the fourth item:</p>
<p class="CodeLabel"><b>motorcycles.py</b></p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles[3])</code></pre>
<p>This example results in an <em>index error</em>:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "motorcycles.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(motorcycles[3])
          ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range</code></pre>
<p>Python attempts to give you the item at index 3. But when it searches the list, no item in <code>motorcycles</code> has an index of 3. Because of the off-by-one nature of indexing in lists, this error is typical. People think the third item is item number 3, because they start counting at 1. But in Python the third item is number 2, because it starts indexing at 0.</p>
<p>An index error means Python can’t find an item at the index you requested. If an index error occurs in your program, try adjusting the index you’re asking for by one. Then run the program again to see if the results are correct.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list, you should use the index <code>-1</code>. This will always work, even if your list has changed size since the last time you accessed it:</p>
<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']</span>
print(motorcycles[-1])</code></pre>
<p>The index <code>-1</code> always returns the last item in a list, in this case the value <code>'suzuki'</code>:</p>
<pre><code>suzuki</code></pre>
<p>The only time this approach will cause an error is when you request the last item from an empty list:</p>
<pre><code>motorcycles = []
print(motorcycles[-1])</code></pre>
<p>No items are in <code>motorcycles</code>, so Python returns another index error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "motorcyles.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(motorcycles[-1])
          ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^
IndexError: list index out of range</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_47" title="47"></span>If an index error occurs and you can’t figure out how to resolve it, try printing your list or just printing the length of your list. Your list might look much different than you thought it did, especially if it has been managed dynamically by your program. Seeing the actual list, or the exact number of items in your list, can help you sort out such logical errors.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502703c03-0005">Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the individual items in a list. You learned how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned how to sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes. You also learned how to find the length of a list and how to avoid index errors when you’re working with lists.</p>
<p>In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span> you’ll learn how to work with items in a list more efficiently. By looping through each item in a list using just a few lines of code you’ll be able to work efficiently, even when your list contains thousands or millions of items.</p>
