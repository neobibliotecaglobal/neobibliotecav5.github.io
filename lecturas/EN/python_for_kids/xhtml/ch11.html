  So far, we’ve covered the fundamentals of computer programming. You’ve learned how to use variables to store information,
  <span class="literal1">
   if
  </span>
  statements for conditional code, and
  <span class="literal1">
   for
  </span>
  loops for repeating code. You know how to create functions to reuse your code, and how to use classes and objects to divide your code into smaller chunks that are easier to understand. You’ve learned how to draw graphics on the screen with both the
  <span class="literal1">
   turtle
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  modules. Now, it’s time to use that knowledge to create your first game.

  Whack the Bouncing Ball
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  We’re going to develop a game with a bouncing ball and a paddle. The ball will fly around the screen, and the player will bounce it off the paddle. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig01">
   Figure 11-1

</p>
<p class="indent">
  Our game may look quite simple, but the code will be a bit trickier than what we’ve written so far because it needs to handle a lot of things. For example, it needs to animate the paddle and the ball, and detect when the ball hits the paddle or the walls.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this chapter, we’ll begin creating the game by adding a game canvas and a bouncing ball. In the next chapter, we’ll complete the game by adding the paddle.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch11lev1sec2">
  Creating the Game Canvas
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  To create your game, first open a new file in IDLE by choosing
  <strong class="calibre5">
   File
  </strong>
<strong class="calibre5">
   ▸
  </strong>
<strong class="calibre5">
   New File
  </strong>
  . Then import
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  and create a
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas
  </span>
  to draw on:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">   <span class="orange">from</span> tkinter <span class="orange">import</span> *
   <span class="orange">import</span> random
   <span class="orange">import</span> time
   <span id="page_173"></span>tk = Tk()
<span class="ent">➊</span> tk.title(<span class="green">'Bounce Game'</span>)
   tk.resizable(0, 0)
   tk.wm_attributes(<span class="green">'-topmost'</span>, 1)
   canvas = Canvas(tk, width=500, height=400, bd=0, highlightthickness=0)
   canvas.pack()
   tk.update()</pre>
<p class="indent">
  This code is a little different from previous examples. First, we import the
  <span class="literal1">
   time
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   random
  </span>
  modules with
  <span class="literal1">
   import random
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   import time
  </span>
  , to use a bit later in the code. The
  <span class="literal1">
   random
  </span>
  module provides (among other things) functions for creating random numbers, and
  <span class="literal1">
   time
  </span>
  has a useful function that will tell Python to pause what it’s doing for a period of time.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  With
  <span class="literal1">
   tk.title(’Bounce Game’)
  </span>
<span class="ent">
   ➊
  </span>
  , we use the
  <span class="literal1">
   title
  </span>
  function of the
  <span class="literal1">
   tk
  </span>
  object we created with
  <span class="literal1">
   tk = Tk()
  </span>
  to give the window a title. Then we use
  <span class="literal1">
   resizable
  </span>
  to make the window a fixed size. The parameters (
  <span class="literal1">
   0, 0
  </span>
  ) say, “The size of the window cannot be changed either horizontally or vertically.” Next, we call
  <span class="literal1">
   wm_
  </span>
  attributes to tell
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  to place the window containing our canvas in front of all other windows (
  <span class="literal1">
   ‘-topmost’
  </span>
  ).
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  When we create a
  <span class="literal1">
   Canvas
  </span>
  object, we pass in a few more named parameters than with previous examples. For example, both
  <span class="literal1">
   bd=0
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   highlightthickness=0
  </span>
  make sure there’s no border around the outside of the canvas, which makes it look better on our game screen. The line
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas.pack()
  </span>
  tells the canvas to size itself according to the width and height parameters given in the preceding line. Finally,
  <span class="literal1">
   tk.update()
  </span>
  tells
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  to initialize itself for the animation in our game. Without this last line, nothing would work as expected.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Make sure you save your code as you go. Give it a meaningful filename the first time you save it, such as
  <em class="calibre7">
   paddleball.py
  </em>
  .

<span class="calibre2" id="page_174">
</span>
  Creating the Ball Class
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Now we’ll create the class for the ball. We’ll begin with the code we need for the ball to draw itself on the canvas. We need to do the following:
 </p>
<ol class="calibre9">
<li class="noindent1">
   Create a
   <span class="literal1">
    class
   </span>
   called
   <span class="literal1">
    Ball
   </span>
   that takes parameters for the canvas and the color of the ball we’re going to draw.
  </li>
<li class="noindent1">
   Save the canvas as an object variable because we’ll draw our ball on it.
  </li>
<li class="noindent1">
   Draw a filled circle on the canvas by using the value of the
   <span class="literal1">
    color
   </span>
   parameter as the fill color.
  </li>
<li class="noindent1">
   Save the identifier
   <span class="literal1">
    tkinter
   </span>
   returns when it draws the circle (oval) because we’re going use this to move the ball around the screen.
  </li>
<li class="noindent1">
   Move the oval to the middle of the canvas.
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">
  This code should be added just after the first three lines in the file (after
  <span class="literal1">
   import time
  </span>
  ):
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="gray">from tkinter import *
import random
import time</span>

<span class="orange">class</span> Ball:
    <span class="orange">def</span> __init__(self, canvas, color):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.id = canvas.create_oval(10, 10, 25, 25, fill=color)
        self.canvas.move(self.id, 245, 100)

    <span class="orange">def</span> draw(self):
        <span class="orange">pass</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  First, we name our class
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  . Then we create an initialization function (as described in “Initializing an Object” on
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch08.xhtml#ch08lev1sec11">
   page 109
  </a>
  ) that takes the parameters
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   color
  </span>
  . We set the object variable
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas
  </span>
  to the value of the parameter of the same name. We then call the
  <span class="literal1">
   create_oval
  </span>
  function with five parameters:
  <em class="calibre7">
   x
  </em>
  and
  <em class="calibre7">
   y
  </em>
  coordinates for the top-left corner (10 and 10),
  <em class="calibre7">
   x
  </em>
  and
  <em class="calibre7">
   y
  </em>
  coordinates for the bottom-right corner (25 and 25), and the fill color for the oval.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_175">
</span>
  The
  <span class="literal1">
   create_oval
  </span>
  function returns an identifier for the shape it’s drawn, which we store in the object variable
  <span class="literal1">
   id
  </span>
  . We move the oval to the middle of the canvas (coordinates 245, 100). The canvas knows what to move because we use the stored shape identifier (
  <span class="literal1">
   id
  </span>
  ) to identify it.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  On the last two lines of the
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  class, we create the
  <span class="literal1">
   draw
  </span>
  function with
  <span class="literal1">
   def
  </span>
<span class="literal1">
   draw(self)
  </span>
  , and the body of the function is simply the
  <span class="literal1">
   pass
  </span>
  keyword. At the moment, it does nothing, but we’ll add more to this function shortly.
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre121" src="../images/f0175-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<p class="indent">
  Now that we’ve created our
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  class, we need to create an object of this class (remember: a class describes what it can do, but the object is the thing that actually does it). Add this code to the bottom of the program to create a red ball object:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">ball = Ball(canvas, <span class="green">'red'</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent" id="para95">
  You can run this program using
  <strong class="calibre5">
   Run
  </strong>
<strong class="calibre5">
   ▸
  </strong>
<strong class="calibre5">
   Run Module
  </strong>
  . If you do this outside of IDLE, the canvas will appear for a split second and then vanish. To stop the window from closing immediately, we need to add an animation loop, which is called the
  <em class="calibre7">
   main loop
  </em>
  of our game. (IDLE already has a main loop, which is why the window doesn’t vanish when you run it there.)
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  A main loop is the central part of a program that generally controls most of what it does. Our main loop, for the moment, just tells
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  to redraw the screen. The loop, also called the
  <em class="calibre7">
   infinite loop
  </em>
  , keeps running forever (or at least until we close the window), constantly telling
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  to redraw the screen and then sleeping for one hundredth of a second by using
  <span class="literal1">
   time.sleep
  </span>
  . We’ll add this code to the end of our program:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">ball = Ball(canvas, <span class="green">'red'</span>)

<span class="orange">while</span> <span class="violet">True</span>:
    tk.update_idletasks()
    tk.update()
    time.sleep(0.01)</pre>
<p class="noindent">
<span id="page_176">
</span>
  Now if you run the code, the ball should appear in the center of the canvas, as shown in
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig02">
   Figure 11-2
  </a>
  .

  To move the ball, change the

<p class="noindent">
  Since
  <span class="literal1">

  </span>
  saved the
  <span class="literal1">

  </span>
  object variable, we use that variable with
  <span class="literal1">
   self.canvas
  </span>
  and call the
  <span class="literal1">
   move
  </span>
  function on the canvas.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We pass three parameters to
  <span class="literal1">

  <span class="literal1">

  and
  <span class="literal1">

  . The
  <span class="literal1">
   0
  </span>
  tells the ball to not move horizontally, and the
  <span class="literal1">
   -1
  </span>
  tells the ball to move 1 pixel up the screen.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We’re making this small change because it’s beneficial to try things out as we go. Imagine writing the entire code for our game all at once and then discovering that it didn’t work. Where would we begin looking to figure out what went wrong?
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We’ll also change the main loop at the bottom of our program. In the block of the
  <span class="literal1">
   while
  </span>
  loop (our main loop), we add a call to the
  <span class="literal1">
   ball
  </span>
  object’s

  function, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="gray">while True:</span>

    <span class="gray">tk.update_idletasks()
    tk.update()

  If you run this code now, the ball should move up the canvas and vanish off the top of the screen—the commands

   update

  tell

 </p>
<p class="indent">
  The

  <span class="literal1">
   time
  </span>
  module, which tells Python to sleep for one hundredth of a second (
  <span class="literal1">
   0.01

  Making the Ball Bounce
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  A ball that vanishes off the top of the screen isn’t particularly useful for our game, so let’s make it bounce. First, we’ll save a few additional object variables in the initialization function of the
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  class, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    <span class="gray">def __init__(self, canvas, color):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.id = canvas.create_oval(10, 10, 25, 25, fill=color)

        self.x = 0
        self.y = -1
        self.canvas_height = self.canvas.winfo_height()</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We’ve added three more lines to our program. With
  <span class="literal1">
   self.x = 0
  </span>
  , we set the object variable
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  to 0; with
  <span class="literal1">
   self.y = -1
  </span>
  , we set the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   y
  </span>
  to −1. Lastly, we set the object variable
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas_height
  </span>
  by calling the
  <span class="literal1">
   winfo_height
  </span>
  canvas function. This function returns the current height of the canvas.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Next, we change the
  <span class="literal1">
   draw
  </span>
  function again:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    <span class="orange">def</span> draw(self):
        self.canvas.move(self.id, self.x, self.y)
        pos = self.canvas.coords(self.id)
        <span class="orange">if</span> pos[1] &lt;= 0:
            self.y = 1 
        <span class="orange">if</span> pos[3] &gt;= self.canvas_height:
            self.y = -1</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We first change the call to the canvas’s
  <span class="literal1">
   move
  </span>
  function by passing the
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   y
  </span>
  object variables. Next, we create a variable called
  <span class="literal1">
   pos
  </span>
  by calling the
  <span class="literal1">
   coords
  </span>
  canvas function. This function returns the current
  <em class="calibre7">
   x
  </em>
  and
  <em class="calibre7">
   y
  </em>
  coordinates of anything drawn on the canvas as long as you know its identifying number. In this case, we pass
  <span class="literal1">
   coords
  </span>
  the object variable
  <span class="literal1">
   id
  </span>
  , which contains the oval’s identifier.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_180">
</span>
  The
  <span class="literal1">
   coords
  </span>
  function returns the coordinates as a list of four numbers. If we print the results of calling this function, we’ll see something like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="violet">print</span>(self.canvas.coords(self.id))
<span class="blue1">[255.0, 29.0, 270.0, 44.0]</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  The first two numbers in the list (
  <span class="literal1">
   255.0
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   29.0
  </span>
  ) contain the top-left coordinates of the oval (
  <em class="calibre7">
   x1
  </em>
  and
  <em class="calibre7">
   y1
  </em>
  ), and the second pair (
  <span class="literal1">
   270.0
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   44.0
  </span>
  ) are the bottom-right
  <em class="calibre7">
   x2
  </em>
  and
  <em class="calibre7">
   y2
  </em>
  coordinates. We’ll use these values in the next few lines of code.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We continue our code by seeing if the
  <em class="calibre7">
   y1
  </em>
  coordinate (that’s the top of the ball!) is less than or equal to 0. If so, we set the
  <span class="literal1">
   y
  </span>
  object variable to
  <span class="literal1">
   1
  </span>
  . In effect, we’re saying if you hit the top of the screen,
  <span class="literal1">

  will stop subtracting 1 from the vertical position, and the ball will stop moving up (this is a simple version of
  <em class="calibre7">
   collision detection

  ).
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre124" src="../images/f0180-01.jpg"/>

  We then see if the

  coordinate (that’s the bottom of the ball!) is greater than or equal to the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas_height
  </span>
  . If it is, we set the
  <span class="literal1">
   y

  object variable back to
  <span class="literal1">
   -1
  </span>

  Changing the Ball’s Starting Direction
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Making a ball bounce slowly up and down isn’t much of a game, so let’s enhance things a bit by changing the ball’s starting direction—the angle it moves when the game starts.
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre125" src="../images/f0180-02.jpg"/>
</div>
<p class="indent">
  In the
  <span class="literal1">
   __init__
  </span>
  function, change these two lines:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    self.x = 0
    self.y = -1</pre>
<p class="indent">
  to the following code (make sure you have the right number of spaces—there are eight—at the beginning of each line):
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span id="page_181"></span>    starts = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]
    self.x = random.choice(starts)
    self.y = 3</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We begin by creating the
  <span class="literal1">
   starts
  </span>
  variable with a list of six numbers. Then we set the value of the
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  variable, using the
  <span class="literal1">
   random.choice
  </span>
  function, which returns a random item from a list. By using that function,
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  can be any number in the list, from –3 to 3.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Lastly, we change
  <span class="literal1">
   y
  </span>
  to –3 (so the ball starts the game moving upward). Now our ball can move in any direction, but we need to make a few more additions to be sure it won’t vanish off the side of the screen. Add the following line to the end of the
  <span class="literal1">
   __init__
  </span>
  function to save the width of the canvas to a new
  <span class="literal1">
   canvas_width
  </span>
  object variable:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    self.canvas_width = self.canvas.winfo_width()</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We’ll use this new object variable in the
  <span class="literal1">
   draw
  </span>
  function to see if the ball has hit the left or right side of the canvas:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    <span class="orange">if</span> pos[0] &lt;= 0 <span class="orange">or</span> pos[2] &gt;= self.canvas_width:
        self.x = self.x * -1</pre>
<p class="indent">
  If the leftmost position of the ball is less than or equal to 0, or the rightmost position of the ball is greater than or equal to the width of the canvas, we do this odd little calculation
  <span class="literal1">
   self.x = self.x * -1
  </span>
  . The
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  variable is set to the current value of
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  multiplied by –1. So if the value of
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  is 2, the new value will be –2. If the value of
  <span class="literal1">
   x
  </span>
  is –3, the new value will be 3. So when the ball hits a side, it will bounce back in the opposite direction. We can do a similar check for the top and bottom of the canvas, using the canvas height and multiplying the
  <span class="literal1">
   y
  </span>
  variable by –1. Your
  <span class="literal1">
   draw
  </span>
  function should now look like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">    <span class="orange">def</span> draw(self):
        self.canvas.move(self.id, self.x, self.y)
        pos = self.canvas.coords(self.id)
        <span class="orange">if</span> pos[0] &lt;= 0 <span class="orange">or</span> pos[2] &gt;= self.canvas_width:
            self.x = self.x * -1
        <span class="orange">if</span> pos[1] &lt;= 0 <span class="orange">or</span> pos[3] &gt;= self.canvas_height:
            self.y = self.y * -1</pre>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_182">

  What You Learned
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In this chapter, we started creating our first game using the
  <span class="literal1">
   tkinter
  </span>
  module. We created a
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  object and animated it to move around the screen. We used coordinates to check when the ball hits the sides of the canvas so we can make it bounce. We also used the
  <span class="literal1">
   choice
  </span>
  function in the
  <span class="literal1">
   random
  </span>
  module so our ball doesn’t always start moving in the same direction. In the next chapter, we’ll complete the game by adding the paddle.

  Programming Puzzles
 </h3>
<h4 class="h3" id="ch11lev2sec4">
  #1: Changing Colors
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Try changing the starting color of the ball and the background color of the canvas—try a few different combinations of colors and see which ones you like.
 </p>
<h4 class="h3" id="ch11lev2sec5">
  #2: Flashing Colors
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Because there’s a loop at the bottom of our code, it should be quite easy to change the color of the ball as it moves across the screen. We can add some code to the loop that picks different colors (think about the
  <span class="literal1">
   choice
  </span>
  function we used earlier in the chapter), and then updates the color of the ball (perhaps by calling a new function on our
  <span class="literal1">
   Ball
  </span>
  class). To do this, you’ll need to use the
  <span class="literal1">
   itemconfig
  </span>
  function on the canvas (see “More Ways to Use the Identifier” on
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10lev1sec14">
   page 165
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
<h4 class="h3" id="ch11lev2sec6">
  #3: Take Your Positions!
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Try to change the code so the ball starts in a different position on the screen. You could make the position random by using the
  <span class="literal1">
   random
  </span>
  module (see section “Drawing a Lot of Rectangles” on
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10lev1sec6">
   page 145
  </a>
  for an example of how to use the
  <span class="literal1">
   randrange
  </span>
  function in that module). But you’ll have to ensure the ball doesn’t start too close, or below, the paddle, which will make the game impossible to play.

  #4: Adding the Paddle . . . ?
 </h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Based on the code we’ve created so far, can you figure out how to add the paddle before reaching the next chapter? If you look back at
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">
   Chapter 10
  </a>
  , you might be able to figure out how to draw it before moving on. Then check the next few pages to see if you got it right!
