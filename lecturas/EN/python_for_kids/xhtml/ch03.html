   Chapter 2

You’ll use strings to display messages in your programs (such as “Get Ready” and “Game Over” messages in a game). You’ll also discover how lists, tuples, and dictionaries are used to store collections of things.

  Strings
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  When programming, we usually call text a
  <em class="calibre7">
   string
  </em>
  . Think of a string as a collection of letters. All the letters, numbers, and symbols in this book could be a string, and so could your name and address. In fact, the first Python program we created in
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">
   Chapter 1
  </a>
  used a string: “Hello World.”
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec2">
  Creating Strings
 </h3>
<p class="indent">
  In Python, we create a string by putting quotes around text because programming languages need to distinguish between different types of values. (We need to tell the computer whether a value is a number, a string, or something else.) For example, we could take our
  <span class="literal1">
   fred
  </span>
  variable from
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">
   Chapter 2
  </a>
  and use it to label a string:
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre31" src="../images/f0026-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<pre class="pre">fred = "Why do gorillas have big nostrils? Big fingers!!"</pre>
<p class="indent">
  Then, to see what’s “inside”
  <span class="literal1">
   fred
  </span>
  , we could enter
  <span class="literal1">
   print(fred)
  </span>
  :
 </p>
<pre class="calibre32"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(fred)
<span class="blue1">Why do gorillas have big nostrils? Big fingers!!</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  You can also use single quotes to create a string, like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred = <span class="green">'What is pink and fluffy? Pink fluff!!'</span>
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(fred)
<span class="blue1">What is pink and fluffy? Pink fluff!!</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  However, if you try to enter more than one line of text for your string using only a single (
  <span class="literal1">
   ′
  </span>
  ) or double quote (
  <span class="literal1">
   "
  </span>
  ) or if you start with one type of quote and finish with another, you’ll get an error message in the Python Shell. For example, enter the following line:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred = "How do dinosaurs pay their bills?</pre>
<p class="indent">
  You’ll see this result:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="red">SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_27">
</span>
  This is an error message complaining about syntax because you did not follow the rules for ending a string with a single or double quote.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre7">
   Syntax
  </em>
  means the arrangement and order of words in a sentence or, in this case, the arrangement and order of words and symbols in a program. So
  <em class="calibre7">
   SyntaxError
  </em>
  means that you did something in an order Python was not expecting, or Python was expecting something that you missed.
  <em class="calibre7">
   EOL
  </em>
  means
  <em class="calibre7">
   end-of-line
  </em>
  , so the rest of the error message is telling you that Python hit the end of the line and did not find a double quote to close (or finish) the string.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  To use more than one line of text in your string (called a
  <em class="calibre7">
   multiline string
  </em>
  ), use three single quotes (
  <span class="literal1">
   ’’’
  </span>
  ), and then hit ENTER between lines, like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fred = <span class="green">'''How do dinosaurs pay their bills?</span>
    <span class="green">With tyrannosaurus checks!'''</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Let’s print the contents of
  <span class="literal1">
   fred
  </span>
  to see if this worked:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(fred)
<span class="blue1">How do dinosaurs pay their bills?</span>
<span class="blue1">With tyrannosaurus checks!</span></pre>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec3">
  Handling Problems with Strings
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Now consider this silly example of a string, which causes Python to display an error message:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> silly_string = <span class="green">'He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't."'</span>
<span class="red">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  In the first line, we try to create a string (defined as the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   silly_string
  </span>
  ) enclosed by single quotes, but also containing a mixture of single quotes in the words
  <span class="literal1">
   can’t
  </span>
  ,
  <span class="literal1">
   shouldn’t
  </span>
  , and
  <span class="literal1">
   wouldn’t
  </span>
  , as well as double quotes. What a mess!
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Remember that Python is not as smart as a human being, so all it sees is a string containing
  <span class="literal1">
   He said, "Aren
  </span>
  , followed by a bunch of other characters that it doesn’t expect. When Python sees a quotation mark (either a single or double quote), it expects a string to start following the first quotation mark and the string to end after the next matching quotation mark
  <span id="page_28">
</span>
  (either single or double) on that line. In this case, the start of the string is the single quotation mark before
  <span class="literal1">
   He
  </span>
  , and the end of the string, as far as Python is concerned, is the single quote after the
  <span class="literal1">
   n
  </span>
  in
  <span class="literal1">
   Aren
  </span>
  .
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the last line, Python tells us what sort of error occurred—in this example, a syntax error.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Using double instead of single quotes still produces an error:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> silly_string = <span class="green">"He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't.""</span>
<span class="red">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Here, Python sees a string bound by double quotes, containing the letters
  <span class="literal1">
   He
  </span>
<span class="literal1">
   said,
  </span>
  (and a space). Everything following that string (from
  <span class="literal1">
   Aren’t
  </span>
  on) causes the error.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  This is because, from Python’s perspective, all that extra stuff isn’t supposed to be there. Python looks for the next matching quote and doesn’t know what you want it to do with anything that follows that quote on the same line.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  The solution to this problem is a multiline string, which we learned about earlier, using
  <em class="calibre7">
   three
  </em>
  single quotes (
  <span class="literal1">
   '''
  </span>
  ). This allows us to combine double and single quotes in our string without causing errors. In fact, if we use three single quotes, we can put any combination of single and double quotes inside the string (as long as we don’t try to put three single quotes there). The error-free version of our string looks like this:
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre33" src="../images/f0028-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<pre class="pre">silly_string = <span class="green">'''He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't."'''</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  But wait, there’s more. If you really want to use single or double quotes to surround a string in Python, instead of three single quotes, you can add a backslash (∖) before each quotation mark within the string. This is called
  <em class="calibre7">
   escaping
  </em>
  . It’s a way of telling Python, “Yes, I know I have quotes inside my string, and I want you to ignore them until you see the end quote.”
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Escaping strings can make them harder to read, so it’s considered better practice to use multiline strings. Still, you might
  <span id="page_29">
</span>
  come across code that uses escaping, so it’s helpful to know why the backslashes are there.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Here are a few examples of how escaping works:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> single_quote_str = <span class="green">'He said, "Aren\'t can\'t shouldn\'t</span>
       <span class="green">wouldn\'t."'</span>
<span class="ent">➋</span> <span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> double_quote_str = <span class="green">"He said, \"Aren't can't shouldn't</span> 
       <span class="green">wouldn't.\""</span>
   <span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(single_quote_str)
   <span class="blue1">He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't."</span>
   <span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(double_quote_str)
   <span class="blue1">He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't."</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  First, at
  <span class="ent">
   ➊
  </span>
  , we create a string with single quotes, using the backslash in front of the single quotes inside that string. At
  <span class="ent">
   ➋
  </span>
  , we create a string with double quotes, and use the backslash in front of those quotes in the string. In the lines that follow, we print the variables we’ve just created. Notice that the backslash character doesn’t appear in the strings when we print them.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec4">
  Embedding Values in Strings
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  If you want to display a message using the contents of a variable, you can embed it in a special string, called an
  <em class="calibre7">
   f-string
  </em>
  (also known as a
  <em class="calibre7">
   formatted string literal
  </em>
  ). You put braces around the variable name, which will then be replaced by the actual value. (
  <em class="calibre7">
   Embedding values
  </em>
  , also referred to as
  <em class="calibre7">
   string substitution
  </em>
  , is programmer-speak for “inserting values.”)
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  For example, to have Python calculate or store the number of points you scored in a game, and then add it to a sentence like “I scored 10 points,” add an
  <span class="literal1">
   f
  </span>
  before the first quote and then replace the number 10 with the variable surrounded by braces
  <span class="literal1">
   {}
  </span>
  , like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> myscore = 1000
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> message = f<span class="green">'I scored {myscore} points'</span>
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(message)
<span class="blue1">I scored 1000 points</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Here, we create the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   myscore
  </span>
  with the value
  <span class="literal1">
   1000
  </span>
  and the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   message
  </span>
  that contains the f-string
  <span class="green">
<span class="literal1">
    'I scored {myscore}
    <span id="page_30">
</span>
    points'
   </span>
</span>
  . On the next line, we call
  <span class="literal1">
   print(message)
  </span>
  to see the result of our string substitution. The result of printing this message is
  <span class="literal1">
   I scored 1000 points
  </span>
  . We don’t need to use a variable for the message. We could do the same example and just use this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="violet">print</span>(f<span class="green">'I scored {myscore} points'</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We can also use more than one variable in a string:
 </p>
<pre class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt; first = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; second = 8
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="violet">print</span>(f<span class="green">'What did the number {first} say to the number {second}? Nice belt!!'</span>)
<span class="blue1">What did the number 0 say to the number 8? Nice belt!!</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  We can even put expressions in an f-string, like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(f<span class="green">'Two plus two equals {2 + 2}'</span>)
<span class="blue1">Two plus two equals 4</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  In this example, Python evaluates the simple equation between the braces, so the printed string contains the result.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec5">
  Multiplying Strings
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  What is 10 multiplied by 5? The answer is 50, of course. But what’s 10 multiplied by
  <em class="calibre7">
   a
  </em>
  ? Here’s Python’s answer:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(10 * <span class="green">'a'</span>)
<span class="blue1">aaaaaaaaaa</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Python programmers might multiply strings for a number of reasons, such as to line up text with a specific number of spaces when displaying messages in the Python Shell. Try printing the following letter in the Python Shell (select

  Lists Are More Powerful than Strings
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  “Spider legs, toe of frog, bat wing, slug butter, and snake dandruff” is not a very normal shopping list (unless you happen to be a wizard), but we’ll use it as our first example of the differences between strings and lists. We could store this list of items in the
  <span class="literal1">
   wizard_list
  </span>
  variable by using a string like so:
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre35" src="../images/f0032-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<pre class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt; wizard_list = <span class="green">'spider legs, toe of frog, bat wing, slug butter, snake dandruff'</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">spider legs, toe of frog, bat wing, slug butter, snake dandruff</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  But we could also create a
  <em class="calibre7">
   list
  </em>
  , a somewhat magical Python object that we can manipulate. Here’s what these items would look like written as a list:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list = [<span class="green">'spider legs'</span>, <span class="green">'toe of frog'</span>, <span class="green">'bat wing'</span>,
                   <span class="green">'slug butter'</span>, <span class="green">'snake dandruff'</span>]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'bat wing', 'slug butter',
'snake dandruff']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Creating a list takes a bit more typing than creating a string, but a list is more useful than a string because items in the list can be easily manipulated. We can print an item in the list by entering a number (called the
  <em class="calibre7">
   index position
  </em>
  ) inside square brackets, like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list[2])
<span class="blue1">bat wing</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  If you were expecting the second item to be
  <span class="literal1">
   ‘toe of frog’
  </span>
  , you might be wondering why
  <span class="literal1">
   ‘bat wing’
  </span>
  was printed. This is
  <span id="page_33">
</span>
  because lists start at index position 0, so the first item in a list is 0, the second is 1, and the
  <strong class="calibre5">
   third
  </strong>
  is 2. That may not make a lot of sense to humans, but it does to computers.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We can also change an item in a list. Perhaps our wizard friend just let us know that we need to grab snail tongue for them instead of bat wing. Here’s how we would change the item in our list:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list[2] = <span class="green">'snail tongue'</span>
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'snail tongue', 'slug butter',
'snake dandruff']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  This sets the item in index position 2, previously bat wing, to snail tongue.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We can also show a sublist of the items in the list. We do this by using a colon (
  <span class="literal1">
   :
  </span>
  ) inside square brackets. For example, enter the following to see the third to fifth items in our list (a brilliant set of ingredients for a lovely sandwich):
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre36" src="../images/f0033-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list[2:5])
<span class="blue1">['snail tongue', 'slug butter', 'snake dandruff']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Writing
  <span class="literal1">
   [2:5]
  </span>
  is the same as saying, “Show the items from index position 2 up to (but not including) index position 5”—in other words, items 3, 4, and 5.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Lists can be used to store all sorts of items, like numbers:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> some_numbers = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20]</pre>
<p class="indent">
  They can also hold strings:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> some_strings = [<span class="green">'Which'</span>, <span class="green">'Witch'</span>, <span class="green">'Is'</span>, <span class="green">'Which'</span>]</pre>
<p class="indent">
  They might have mixtures of numbers and strings:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> numbers_and_strings = [<span class="green">'Why'</span>, <span class="green">'was'</span>, 6, <span class="green">'afraid'</span>, <span class="green">'of'</span>, 7, 
                           <span class="green">'because'</span>, 7, 8, 9]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(numbers_and_strings)

  This list-within-list example creates three variables:
  <span class="literal1">
   numbers
  </span>
  with four numbers,
  <span class="literal1">
   strings
  </span>
  with eight strings, and
  <span class="literal1">
   mylist
  </span>
  using
  <span class="literal1">
   numbers
  </span>
  and
  <span class="literal1">
   strings
  </span>
  . The third list (
  <span class="literal1">
   mylist
  </span>
  ) has only two elements because it’s a list of variable names, not the contents of the variables.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  We can try printing the two elements of
  <span class="literal1">
   mylist
  </span>
  separately:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(mylist[0])
<span class="blue1">[1, 2, 3, 4]</span>
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(mylist[1])
<span class="blue1">['I', 'kicked', 'my', 'toe', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'sore']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Here we can see
  <span class="literal1">
   mylist[0]
  </span>
  contains the list of numbers, and
  <span class="literal1">
   mylist[1]
  </span>
  is the list of strings.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec7">
  Adding Items to a List
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  To add items to the end of a list, we use the
  <span class="literal1">
   append
  </span>
  function. For example, to add a bear burp (I’m sure there is such a thing) to the wizard’s shopping list, enter the following:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list.append(<span class="green">'bear burp'</span>)
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'snail tongue', 'slug butter', 
'snake dandruff', 'bear burp']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  You can keep adding more magical items to the wizard’s list in the same way, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list.append(<span class="green">'mandrake'</span>)
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list.append(<span class="green">'hemlock'</span>)
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> wizard_list.append(<span class="green">'swamp gas'</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">
  Now the wizard’s list looks like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span id="page_35"></span><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'snail tongue', 'slug butter',
'snake dandruff', 'bear burp', 'mandrake', 'hemlock', 'swamp gas']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  The wizard is clearly ready to work some serious magic!
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec8">
  Removing Items from a List
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  To remove items from a list, use the
  <span class="literal1">
   del
  </span>
  command (short for
  <em class="calibre7">
   delete
  </em>
  ). For example, to remove the fifth item in the wizard’s list, snake dandruff, do this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">del</span> wizard_list[4]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'snail tongue', 'slug butter',
'bear burp', 'mandrake', 'hemlock', 'swamp gas']</span></pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet">
<strong class="calibre3">
<span class="notes">
     NOTE
    </span>
</strong>
</p>
<p class="notep">
<em class="calibre7">
    Remember that positions start at zero, so
    <span class="literal1">
     wizard_list[4]
    </span>
    actually refers to the fifth item in the list.
   </em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">
  Try removing the items we just added (mandrake, hemlock, and swamp gas) by entering the following:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">del</span> wizard_list[7]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">del</span> wizard_list[6]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">del</span> wizard_list[5]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(wizard_list)
<span class="blue1">['spider legs', 'toe of frog', 'snail tongue', 'slug butter',
'bear burp']</span></pre>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec9">
  List Arithmetic
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  We can join lists by adding them, just like adding numbers, using a plus (
  <span class="literal1">
   +
  </span>
  ) sign. For example, suppose we have two lists:
  <span class="literal1">
   list1
  </span>
  , containing the numbers 1 through 4, and
  <span class="literal1">
   list2
  </span>
  , containing some words. We can add them using the
  <span class="literal1">
   +
  </span>
  sign, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list2 = [<span class="green">'I'</span>, <span class="green">'tripped'</span>, <span class="green">'over'</span>, <span class="green">'and'</span>, <span class="green">'hit'</span>, <span class="green">'the'</span>, <span class="green">'floor'</span>]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(list1 + list2)
<span class="blue1">[1, 2, 3, 4, 'I', 'tripped', 'over', 'and', 'hit', 'the', 'floor']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_36">
</span>
  We can also add the two lists and set the result to another variable:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list2 = [<span class="green">'I'</span>, <span class="green">'ate'</span>, <span class="green">'chocolate'</span>, <span class="green">'and'</span>, <span class="green">'I'</span>, <span class="green">'want'</span>, <span class="green">'more'</span>]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list3 = list1 + list2
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(list3)
<span class="blue1">[1, 2, 3, 4, 'I', 'ate', 'chocolate', 'and', 'I', 'want', 'more']</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  And we can multiply a list by a number. For example, to multiply
  <span class="literal1">
   list1
  </span>
  by 5, we write
  <span class="literal1">
   list1 * 5
  </span>
  :
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 = [1, 2]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(list1 * 5)
<span class="blue1">[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  This tells Python to repeat
  <span class="literal1">
   list1
  </span>
  five times, resulting in
  <span class="literal1">
   1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
  </span>
<span class="literal1">
   1, 2, 1, 2
  </span>
  . On the other hand, division (
  <span class="literal1">
   /
  </span>
  ) and subtraction (
  <span class="literal1">
   -
  </span>
  ) give only errors, as in these examples:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 / 20
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;pyshell&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    list1 / 20
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'int'</span>

<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 - 20
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;pyshell&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    list1 - 20
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  But why? Well, joining lists with
  <span class="literal1">
   +
  </span>
  and repeating lists with
  <span class="literal1">
   *
  </span>
  are straightforward enough operations. These concepts also make sense in the real world. For example, if I were to hand you two paper shopping lists and say, “Add these two lists,” you might write out all the items on another sheet of paper in order, end to end. The same might be true if I said, “Multiply this list by 3.” You could imagine writing a list of all of the list’s items three times on another sheet of paper.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  But how would you divide a list? For example, consider how you would divide a list of six numbers (1 through 6) in two. Here are just three different ways:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span id="page_37"></span>[1, 2, 3]     [4, 5, 6]
[1]           [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4]  [5, 6]</pre>
<p class="indent">
  Would we divide the list in the middle, split it after the first item, or just pick some random place and divide it there? There’s no simple answer, and when you ask Python to divide a list, it doesn’t know what to do, either. That’s why it responds with an error.
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre37" src="../images/f0037-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<p class="indent">
  For the same reason, you can’t add anything other than a list to a list. For example, here’s what happens when we try to add the number 50 to
  <span class="literal1">
   list1
  </span>
  :
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> list1 + 50
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  <span class="red">File "&lt;pyshell&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    list1 + 50
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Why do we get an error here? Well, what does it mean to add 50 to a list? Does it mean add 50 to each item? But what if the items aren’t numbers? Does it mean add the number 50 to the end or beginning of the list?
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  In computer programming, commands should work exactly the same way every time you enter them. Your computer sees things only in black and white. Ask it to make a complicated decision, and it throws up its hands with errors.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec10">
  Tuples
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  A
  <em class="calibre7">
   tuple
  </em>
  is like a list that uses parentheses, as in this example:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fibs = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3)
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(fibs[3])
<span>2</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_38">
</span>
  Here we define the variable
  <span class="literal1">
   fibs
  </span>
  as the numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, and 3. Then, as with a list, we print the item in index position 3 in the tuple by using
  <span class="literal1">
   print(fibs[3])
  </span>
  .
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  The main difference between a tuple and a list is that a tuple cannot change once you’ve created it. For example, if we try to replace the first value in the tuple
  <span class="literal1">
   fibs
  </span>
  with the number 4 (just as we replaced values in our
  <span class="literal1">
   wizard_list
  </span>
  ), we get an error message:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fibs[0] = 4
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;pyshell&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    fibs[0] = 4
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  Why would you use a tuple instead of a list? Well, sometimes it’s useful to use something that you know can never change. If you create a tuple with two elements inside, it will always have those two elements.
 </p>
<h3 class="h1" id="ch03lev1sec11">
  Python Dictionaries
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In Python, a
  <em class="calibre7">
   dict
  </em>
  (short for
  <em class="calibre7">
   dictionary
  </em>
  ) is a collection of things, like lists and tuples. The difference between dicts and lists or tuples is that each item in a dict has a
  <em class="calibre7">
   key
  </em>
  and a corresponding
  <em class="calibre7">
   value
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  For example, say we have a list of people and their favorite sports. We could put this information into a Python list, with the person’s name followed by their sport, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> favorite_sports = [<span class="green">'Ralph Williams, Football'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Michael Tippett, Basketball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Edward Elgar, Baseball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Rebecca Clarke, Netball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Ethel Smyth, Badminton'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Frank Bridge, Rugby'</span>]</pre>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_39">
</span>
  If I asked you what Rebecca Clarke’s favorite sport is, you could skim through that list and find the answer is netball. But what if the list included 100 (or many more) people?
 </p>
<div class="image1">
<img alt="Image" class="calibre38" src="../images/f0039-01.jpg"/>
</div>
<p class="indent">
  If we store this same information in a dictionary, with the person’s name as the key and their favorite sport as the value, the code would look like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> favorite_sports = {<span class="green">'Ralph Williams'</span> : <span class="green">'Football'</span>, 
                       <span class="green">'Michael Tippett'</span> : <span class="green">'Basketball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Edward Elgar'</span> : <span class="green">'Baseball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Rebecca Clarke'</span> : <span class="green">'Netball'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Ethel Smyth'</span> : <span class="green">'Badminton'</span>,
                       <span class="green">'Frank Bridge'</span> : <span class="green">'Rugby'</span>}</pre>
<p class="indent">
  We use colons to separate each key from its value, and each key and value is surrounded by single quotes. Notice, too, that the items in a dictionary are enclosed in braces ({}), not parentheses or square brackets. The result is a dict (where each key points to a particular value), as shown in
  <a class="calibre6" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03tab01">

  Now, to get Rebecca Clarke’s favorite sport, we access our dictionary
  <span class="literal1">
   favorite_sports
  </span>
  by using her name as the key, like so:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(favorite_sports[<span class="green">'Rebecca Clarke'</span>])
<span class="blue1">Netball</span></pre>
<p class="noindent">
  And the answer is Netball.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
<span id="page_40">
</span>
  To delete a value in a dict, use its key. For example, let’s remove Ethel Smyth:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">del</span> favorite_sports[<span class="green">'Ethel Smyth'</span>]
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(favorite_sports)
<span class="blue1">{'Rebecca Clarke': 'Netball', 'Michael Tippett': 'Basketball', 
'Ralph Williams': 'Football', 'Edward Elgar': 'Baseball', 
'Frank Bridge': 'Rugby'}</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  To replace a value in a dict, we also use its key. Say we need to change Ralph Williams’s favorite sport from Football to Ice Hockey. We can do so like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> favorite_sports[<span class="green">'Ralph Williams'</span>] = <span class="green">'Ice Hockey'</span>
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(favorite_sports)
<span class="blue1">{'Rebecca Clarke': 'Netball', 'Michael Tippett': 'Basketball', 
'Ralph Williams': 'Ice Hockey', 'Edward Elgar': 'Baseball', 
'Frank Bridge': 'Rugby'}</span></pre>
<p class="indent">
  We replace the favorite sport of Football with Ice Hockey by using the key Ralph Williams.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  As you can see, working with dictionaries is kind of like working with lists and tuples, except that you can’t join dicts with the plus operator (
  <span class="literal1">
   +
  </span>
  ). If you try to do that, you’ll get an error message, as in the following example:

  What You Learned
 </h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In this chapter, you learned how Python uses strings to store text, and how it uses lists and tuples to handle multiple items. You saw that the items in lists can be changed, and that you can join one list to another list, but that the values in a tuple cannot change. You also learned how to use dictionaries to store values with keys that identify them.
