  A computer program is a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform some kind of action. It isn’t the physical parts of a computer—like the wires, microchips, cards, hard drive, and such—but the hidden stuff running on that hardware. A computer program, which I’ll usually refer to as just a
  <em class="calibre7">
   program
  </em>
  , is the set of commands that tells that hardware what to do.
  <em class="calibre7">
   Software
  </em>
  is a collection of computer programs.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Without computer programs, almost every device you use daily would either stop working or be much less useful than it is now. Computer
  <span id="page_4">
</span>
  programs, in one form or another, control not only your personal computer but also video game systems, mobile phones, and the GPS units in cars. Software also controls items like LCD TVs and their remote controllers, as well as some of the newest radios, DVD players, ovens, and some fridges. Even car engines, traffic lights, street lamps, train signals, electronic billboards, and elevators are controlled by programs.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  Programs are a bit like thoughts. If you didn’t have thoughts, you would probably just sit on the floor, staring vacantly at a wall. Your thought “get up off the floor” is an instruction, or
  <em class="calibre7">
   command
  </em>
  , that tells your body to stand up. In the same way, computer programs use commands to tell computers what to do.
 </p>
<p class="indent">
  If you know how to write computer programs, you can do all sorts of useful things. Sure, you may not be able to write programs to control cars, traffic lights, or your fridge (well, at least not at first), but you could create web pages, write your own games, or even make a program to help with homework.

  A Few Words About Language

<p class="noindent">
  Like humans, computers use multiple languages to communicate—these are called programming languages. A
  <em class="calibre7">
   programming language

  is simply a way to talk to a computer by using instructions that both humans and computers can understand.

<p class="indent">
  There are programming languages named after people (like Ada and Pascal), those named using simple acronyms (like BASIC and FORTRAN), and even a few named after TV shows, like Python. Yes, the Python programming language was named after the

  The Python programming language has many features that make it extremely useful for beginners. Most importantly, you can use Python to write simple, efficient programs quite quickly. Python doesn’t use as many complicated symbols as other programming languages, which makes it easier to read
  <span id="page_5">
</span>
  and a lot friendlier for beginners. (That isn’t to say Python doesn’t use symbols—they’re just not used quite as heavily as in many other languages.)

However, if you are using an older version of Windows (like Windows 7), the latest version of Python will not work—in this case, you’ll need to install Python 3.8. See the Windows download page (

  Saving Your Python Programs
 </h3>

  Python programs wouldn’t be very useful if you needed to rewrite them every time you wanted to use them, never mind print them out so you could reference them. Sure, it might be fine to rewrite short programs, but a large program, like a word processor, could contain millions of lines of code. Print that all out, and you could have well over 100,000 pages. Just imagine trying to carry that huge stack of paper home. Better hope that you won’t meet up with a big gust of wind.

  Luckily, we can save our programs for future use. To create and save a new program, open IDLE and choose

  <strong class="calibre5">
   New

<pre class="pre"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>("Hello World")</pre>
<p class="indent">
  Now, choose
  <strong class="calibre5">
   File
