<p class="noindent">This is a momentous occasion. You’ve just finished the book. It’s been a long journey, for me and for you! Since I started writing this book, I’ve grown several beards, lived in three different cities, and found out that bananas don’t produce seeds. Honestly, I’ve had so much fun writing this thing. At moments it was hard and tiring, but I stuck with it because I wanted you to read it.</p>
<p class="indent">Since you started this book, you’ve covered a lot of ground. You’ve learned about the fundamentals of programming in Python and made some really cool programs that use these concepts to do amazing things in Minecraft. You’ve learned about variables, math operations, strings, input, Booleans, <span class="literal">if</span> statements, <span class="literal">while</span> and <span class="literal">for</span> loops, functions, lists and dictionaries, modules, files, and classes. You may have been a complete beginner when you started this book, but with this knowledge, you’ll be capable of doing some really advanced things in Python.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_288"></span>Whatever you choose to do with programming in the future, I sincerely wish you the best of luck. For me, programming has been an amazing hobby that luckily turned into a full-time job.</p>
<p class="indent">If we ever meet in person, make sure we give each other a high five!</p>
