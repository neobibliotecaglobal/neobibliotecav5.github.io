<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">You ask yes-or-no questions all the time: Is it raining? Is my hair too long? Once you know whether the answer is yes or no, you can decide what to do next: bring an umbrella, or not; trim your hair, or not. In all these situations, what you do depends on whether the answer to the question is yes or no. Deciding what to do based on the answer to a question is also important in programming. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to ask questions in Python.</p>
<p class="indent">In programming, the questions you ask are usually about comparing values. Is one value equal to another? Is a value bigger or smaller than another? The yes-or-no question is called a <em>condition</em>, and the answer isn’t <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> but <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>. Say you ask the question “Do I have more gold blocks than my friend?” or, in other words, “Is my gold stash greater than my friend’s gold stash?” To make that question into a condition that Python can understand, we have to phrase it as a statement (such as “My gold stash is greater than my friend’s”) that can be true or false.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"></span>Testing whether a condition is true or false is so useful in Python that there’s a special data type just for storing the values <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">False</span>. So far you’ve seen a few other data types: integer, float, and string data types. The data type that stores <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">False</span> values is the <em>Boolean</em> data type. Booleans can only be <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>. When you use Python to ask questions, the result is either <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>. When a condition is true or false, programmers say that it <em>evaluates to</em> <span class="literal">True</span> or <em>evaluates to</em> <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter you’ll use Booleans, comparison operators, and logical operators to test different conditions involving values. Then you’ll be ready for <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, where you’ll use the answers to questions to make decisions about what to do next in a program.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec01"><strong><span class="blue1">Boolean Basics</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">A Boolean is a bit like a light switch: it is either <span class="literal">True</span> (on) or <span class="literal">False</span> (off). In Python, you can declare a Boolean variable like this to represent that the light is on:</p>
<p class="programs">light = <span class="orange">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here you assign the value <span class="literal">True</span> to the variable <span class="literal">light</span>. To turn the light off, you could assign the value <span class="literal">False</span> to light:</p>
<p class="programs">light = <span class="orange">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Always capitalize the first letter of <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">False</span>. If you don’t, Python won’t recognize the value as a Boolean and will throw an exception instead of evaluating your calculation!</p>
<p class="indent">In the next mission, you’ll use Booleans to stop the player from smashing blocks in the game world.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec01"><strong>Mission #17: Stop Smashing Blocks!</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In Minecraft, it’s easy to smash blocks, which is great when you want to mine for resources. But it’s annoying to spend ages building a really cool structure and then accidentally smash and destroy it! In this mission, you’ll make your Minecraft world indestructible.</p>
<p class="indent">By using <span class="literal">setting("world_immutable", True)</span> you can make blocks <em>immutable</em>, which means they can’t be changed. The <span class="literal">setting()</span> line of code is a function like the <span class="literal">setTilePos()</span> and <span class="literal">setPos()</span> functions you’ve seen. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex1">Listing 5-1</a> shows how to make the world immutable.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>immutableOn.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs"><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">True</span>)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex1"></a><em>Listing 5-1: Code that stops blocks from being broken</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"></span>The <span class="literal">setting()</span> function has options that you can set to <span class="literal">True</span> to turn them on. One of the options is <span class="literal">"world_immutable"</span>. To turn a <span class="literal">setting()</span> option on, you write <span class="literal">True</span> after the name of the setting inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">Type <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex1">Listing 5-1</a> into IDLE and save it as <em>immutableOn.py</em> in a new folder called <em>booleans</em>. When you run it, you shouldn’t be able to smash most blocks, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>. But what happens when you <em>do</em> want to break blocks again? Copy your program into a new file and change it to allow the player to smash blocks. (Hint: Use a Boolean!) Save the new file as <em>immutableOff.py</em> in the <em>booleans</em> folder.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec02"><strong><span class="blue1">Concatenating Booleans</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Like integers and floats, Booleans must be converted to strings before they can be concatenated. For example, you concatenate Booleans and strings when you want to output Booleans using the <span class="literal">print()</span> function. To do this, use the <span class="literal">str()</span> function:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> agree = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I agree: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(agree))<br/><span class="blue1">I agree: True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">agree</span> variable stores a Boolean. It is converted to a string on the second line with <span class="literal">str(agree)</span>, concatenated to the <span class="literal">"I agree: "</span> string, and printed.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec03"><strong><span class="blue1">Comparators</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You are very good at comparing values. You know that 5 is greater than 2, 8 and 8 are the same number, and 6 and 12 are not the same number. A computer is also good at comparing values; you just need to tell it exactly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"></span>which kind of comparison you want by typing in a symbol called a <em>comparator</em>. For example, do you want it to check if one value is bigger than the other, or do you want it to check if it’s smaller?</p>
<p class="indentb">Comparators (or <em>comparison operators</em>) in Python let you compare data. Python uses six comparators:</p>
<p class="bull">• Equal to (<span class="literal">==</span>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Not equal to (<span class="literal">!=</span>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Less than (<span class="literal">&lt;</span>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Less than or equal to (<span class="literal">&lt;=</span>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Greater than (<span class="literal">&gt;</span>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Greater than or equal to (<span class="literal">&gt;=</span>)</p>
<p class="indentt">Each comparator returns a Boolean value (<span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>) that states whether the condition has been met. Let’s look at these comparators and explore how to use them!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec02"><strong><span class="blue1">Equal To</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When you want to find out whether two values are the same, you can use the equal to comparator (<span class="literal">==</span>). When the values are the same, the comparison returns the Boolean value <span class="literal">True</span>. When the values are different, the comparison returns <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, let’s assign the value of two variables and then use the equal to operator to compare them:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length == width<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The result is <span class="literal">True</span> because the values of the <span class="literal">length</span> and <span class="literal">width</span> variables are the same.</p>
<p class="indent">But if they are different, the result is <span class="literal">False</span>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 4<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 1<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length == width<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">You can use the equal to comparator on all variable types: strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice how I used <span class="literal">==</span> to compare <span class="literal">length</span> and <span class="literal">width</span> instead of <span class="literal">=</span>, which is used to set a variable. Python uses the <span class="literal">==</span> operator to tell the difference between a comparison (asking whether two values are equal) and setting a variable (making a variable equal some value). Try to remember this difference to avoid bugs in your code. Don’t worry; even I make the mistake of using <span class="literal">=</span> instead of <span class="literal">==</span> once in a while!</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec03"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89"></span><strong>Mission #18: Am I Swimming?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ll use comparators to make a program that states whether or not you’re standing in water. The results will be posted to Minecraft chat.</p>
<p class="indent">To find out the block type at certain coordinates, you’ll use the <span class="literal">getBlock()</span> function. This function takes coordinates as three arguments and returns the block type as an integer. For example:</p>
<p class="programs">blockType = mc.getBlock(10, 18, 13)</p>
<p class="indent">Here, I stored the result of <span class="literal">mc.getBlock(10, 18, 13)</span> in a variable called <span class="literal">blockType</span>. If the block type at coordinates (10, 18, 13) is melon (block value 103), the <span class="literal">blockType</span> variable will hold a value of 103.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s put the <span class="literal">getBlock()</span> function to work. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex2">Listing 5-2</a> checks whether the player is standing on dry land.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>swimming.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs"><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>pos = mc.player.getPos()<br/>x = pos.x<br/>y = pos.y<br/>z = pos.z<br/><br/>blockType = mc.getBlock(x, y, z)<br/>mc.postToChat(blockType == 0)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex2"></a><em>Listing 5-2: This code checks the block type where the player’s legs are.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Here, I get the three coordinates of the player’s position and pass those coordinates as arguments to <span class="literal">getBlock()</span>. I store the result of <span class="literal">mc.getBlock(x, y, z)</span> in <span class="literal">blockType</span>. The expression <span class="literal">blockType == 0</span> checks whether the block is air; if it is air, you know you’re just standing somewhere in your Minecraft world, the expression is <span class="literal">True</span>, and <span class="literal">True</span> is posted to chat. If it’s not air, <span class="literal">False</span> is posted to chat, so you must be underwater or maybe drowning in sand!</p>
<p class="indent">Copy <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex2">Listing 5-2</a> and save it as <em>swimming.py</em> in the <em><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a></em> directory. Then change the code so it checks whether the player is standing in water (block type 9) and run it.</p>
<p class="indent">Try standing in water and running the program. Make sure that when the player is in water, the chat displays <span class="literal">True</span>. When the player isn’t in water, the chat should display <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The output of the program should look like <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>At this point, you will not be able to run this program continuously. You must run the program every time you want to check the block below the player. This applies to all the other missions in this chapter as well.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch05sb01"><strong>BONUS OBJECTIVE: I’M FLYING!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">With a couple of changes to the code, you can check whether the block <em>below</em> you is air. This would tell you that you’re flying or jumping. How would you do this?</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec04"><strong><span class="blue1">Not Equal To</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The not equal to comparator is the opposite of the equal to comparator. Instead of checking whether two values are the same, it checks whether they are different. When the two values are different, the comparison evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>. When they are the same, it evaluates to <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say you want to make sure that an object is a rectangle but not a square. Because a non-square rectangle has a different length and width, you could write a comparison to check that the length and width are not equal:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width != length<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">width != length</span> expression asks whether the values of <span class="literal">width</span> and <span class="literal">length</span> are different.</p>
<p class="indent">The result of this comparison is <span class="literal">True</span> because the <span class="literal">width</span> variable and the <span class="literal">length</span> variable have different values.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"></span>But if these values are the same, the comparison returns <span class="literal">False</span>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width != length<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">The not equal to comparator also works with strings, integers, floats, and Booleans, just like the equal to comparator.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec05"><strong>Mission #19: Am I Standing in Something Other Than Air?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to check whether you’re standing in something other than air, such as water, lava, dirt, gravel, or any other type of block. In Mission #18, you checked whether the block at your current position was air, and you worked out how to check whether you were standing in water. You could copy and paste the program many times, changing it slightly each time to check for lava, dirt, gravel, and so on, one by one. But that would be very boring. Instead, use the not equal to comparator to check whether you’re underground, trapped in sand, at the bottom of the ocean, or even drowning in lava!</p>
<p class="indent">Open the program from Mission #18 (<em>swimming.py</em>) and save it as <em>notAir.py</em> in the <em>booleans</em> folder. Delete the last line of the program and replace it with <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex3">Listing 5-3</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>notAir.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">➊</span> notAir = blockType == 0<br/>   mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"The player is not standing in air: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(notAir))</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex3"></a><em>Listing 5-3: Changes to the swimming program</em></p>
<p class="indent">The last line of this code will print whether you’re not standing in air. The result of the comparison is stored in the <span class="literal">notAir</span> variable <span class="ent">➊</span>. When the comparison evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>, the value of the <span class="literal">notAir</span> variable will be <span class="literal">True</span>, and when the comparison evaluates to <span class="literal">False</span>, the value of the <span class="literal">notAir</span> variable will be <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">But the comparison on the first line isn’t quite right <span class="ent">➊</span>. It currently checks whether the <span class="literal">blockType</span> is equal to air using the equal to comparator (<span class="literal">==</span>). Instead it should check whether the <span class="literal">blockType</span> variable is not equal to air using the not equal to comparator (<span class="literal">!=</span>). Change the first line to use the not equal to comparator instead of the equal to comparator. This will check whether the block at the player’s current position is not equal to air.</p>
<p class="indent">When you run the program, make sure it works when you’re standing in air and when you’re underwater, in lava, in gravel, in sand, or teleported into the ground. The message posted to the chat when the condition is <span class="literal">True</span> is shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig3">Figure 5-3</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec06"><strong><span class="blue1">Greater Than and Less Than</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When you need to figure out whether one value is bigger than another, you use the greater than comparator. The greater than comparator will return <span class="literal">True</span> when the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. If the value on the left is less than or the same as the value on the right, the comparison will return <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say we have a minecart that can’t lift more than 99 blocks of obsidian. As long our minecart’s lifting limit is greater than the number of obsidian blocks it’s trying to lift, the blocks can be lifted:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> obsidian = 99<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit &gt; obsidian<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Brilliant! Our minecart can carry any number of obsidian blocks that is less than 100, and 99 is less than 100, so <span class="literal">limit &gt; obsidian</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>. But what if someone adds another block of obsidian to the pile?</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> obsidian = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> canLift = limit &gt; obsidian<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Oh no, now the limit has been reached! The result is now <span class="literal">False</span>: 100 is not greater than 100; it’s the same. Our minecart can’t lift the obsidian.</p>
<p class="indent">The less than comparator works the same way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"></span>A van driving under a bridge needs to know whether it’s small enough to fit under it:</p>

<p class="indent">In this case, the van will fit because it’s smaller than the bridge height: 8 is less than 12. Later in its journey, the same van might encounter another bridge that is too low to drive under:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> vanHeight = 8<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> bridgeHeight = 7<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> vanHeight &lt; bridgeHeight<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec07"><strong><span class="blue1">Greater Than or Equal To and Less Than or Equal To</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Like the greater than comparator, the greater than or equal to comparator determines whether one value is greater than another. Unlike the greater than comparator, it will also evaluate to <span class="literal">True</span> if the values are the same.</p>

<p class="indent">I have enough stickers: 30 is the same as 30, so <span class="literal">stickers &gt;= people</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>. But say one of my friends thinks the stickers look cool and wants one. Now, 31 people want stickers:</p>

<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec09"><strong>Mission #21: Am I Close to Home?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">As you wander around the Minecraft world, you might get lost and forget where your home is. You could wander for hours only to discover you were close to home when you first lost your way.</p>
<p class="indent">With a single line of code, you can check how far you are from any coordinates in the game. For example, you could use the coordinates of your house and your current position to calculate how far away you are. By adding a comparator, you can also check whether or not you are within a certain number of blocks from your house. We’ll say you’re close to home if you’re only 40 blocks away.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write a Python program to check this for you! The code for this mission should check how far you are from your house, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex5">Listing 5-5</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>farFromHome.py</em></span></p>

<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex5"></a><em>Listing 5-5: Code that outputs the distance to your house</em></p>
<p class="indent">This code assumes your house is at the coordinates <span class="literal">x = 10</span> and <span class="literal">z = 10</span>, which are set with the <span class="literal">homeX</span> and <span class="literal">homeZ</span> variables <span class="ent">➊</span>. In this case, we don’t need to know about the y-coordinate. I use the <span class="literal">getTilePos()</span> function to get the player’s position and set the <span class="literal">x</span> and <span class="literal">z</span> values.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"></span>To calculate the <span class="literal">distance</span> variable, we use a formula called the <em>Pythagorean theorem</em>. It calculates the length of a side of a right triangle, and you can use it in Minecraft to work out the distance between two points. You may have seen this formula written in math class as <em>a</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>c</em><sup>2</sup>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are the two legs of a right triangle, and <em>c</em> is the hypotenuse of the triangle, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig5">Figure 5-5</a>. At <span class="ent">➋</span>, we’re solving for <em>c</em>, which is represented by the variable <span class="literal">distance</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Save <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex5">Listing 5-5</a> as <em>farFromHome.py</em> in the <em>booleans</em> folder.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f05-05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch5fig5"></a><em>Figure 5-5: A right triangle</em></p>
<p class="indent">To finish the program, use a less than or equal to comparator to check whether the value of the <span class="literal">distance</span> variable is less than or equal to 40 and post the result to chat in the format of <span class="literal">"Your house is nearby: True/False"</span> <span class="ent">➌</span>. Use concatenation to combine the string with the result of the comparison. Update the contents of the <span class="literal">postToChat()</span> <span class="ent">➌</span> function to output the string.</p>
<p class="indent">Test the program. When you are within 40 blocks of your house, you should receive a <span class="literal">True</span> message; when you aren’t within 40 blocks, you should see a <span class="literal">False</span> message. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig6">Figure 5-6</a> shows the program in operation.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec04"><strong><span class="blue1">Logical Operators</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Combining two or more comparators is often necessary in programs. You might want to determine whether two conditions are <span class="literal">True</span>: for example, you might want a car that is red <em>and</em> costs less than $10,000.</p>
<p class="indent">To combine two or more comparators, you use <em>logical operators</em>. Like comparators, you can use logical operators anywhere that you would use a Boolean value. Logical operators are also called <em>Boolean operators</em>. You’ll learn about three kinds of logical operators: <span class="literal">and</span>, <span class="literal">or</span>, and <span class="literal">not</span>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec10"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97"></span><strong><span class="blue1">and</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Use the <span class="literal">and</span> operator when you want to check whether two comparisons are both <span class="literal">True</span>. For an expression with an <span class="literal">and</span> operator to be <span class="literal">True</span>, both comparisons must be <span class="literal">True</span>. If either comparison is <span class="literal">False</span>, the statement will return <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say I want to find out whether a person is older than 18 and owns a car. I might write the following program:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 21<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ownsCar = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age &gt; 18<span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="orange">and</span> ownsCar == <span class="orange">True</span><span class="ent">➋</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here, we’re combining two comparators at <span class="ent">➊</span> and <span class="ent">➋</span> with <span class="literal">and</span>. Because the age of the person is greater than 18 (<span class="literal">age &gt; 18</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>) and they own a car (<span class="literal">ownsCar == True</span>), the entire expression <span class="literal">age &gt; 18 and ownsCar == True</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">If one of these comparisons was <span class="literal">False</span>, the statement would evaluate to <span class="literal">False</span>. Say the person doesn’t own a car but is older than 18:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 25<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ownsCar = <span class="orange">False</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age &gt; 18 <span class="orange">and</span> ownsCar == <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here, <span class="literal">age &gt; 18</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">ownsCar == True</span> evaluates to <span class="literal">False</span>, making the entire expression <span class="literal">False</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The programs you’ve created so far in this chapter have displayed <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span> depending on whether the player is standing on or in a particular block type. But what if you wanted to check whether the player is in a tree? How would you do this? Because trees are made of wood and leaves, you’d have to check whether the player is standing on wood <em>or</em> leaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write a program. Open <em>swimming.py</em> again and save it as a new program called <em>inTree.py</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"></span>Change the program so it checks the type of block that is one block below the player.

<p class="indent">In other words, <span class="literal">not</span> changes <span class="literal">True</span> to <span class="literal">False</span> and <span class="literal">False</span> to <span class="literal">True</span>:</p>

Let’s imagine you wanted to make sure that you had between 10 and 20 wolves, because you love wolves and want more than 10, but 20 or more might cause problems as you’d run out of food. You could test for this condition by using an <span class="literal">and</span> operator:</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = wolves &gt; 10 <span class="orange">and</span> wolves &lt; 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">But you could also do it another way. Instead of using the <span class="literal">and</span> operator, write the variable once in the middle of two comparisons:</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = 10 &lt; wolves &lt; 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">If you run either of these programs and enter a number between 10 and 20 but not equal to either, then <span class="literal">enoughWolves</span> will be <span class="literal">True</span>. You can do the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104"></span>same using the greater than or equal to operators (<span class="literal">&gt;=</span>) and the less than or equal to operators (<span class="literal">&lt;=</span>):</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = 10 &lt;= wolves &lt;= 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, entering 10 or 20 would also give <span class="literal">enoughWolves</span> a value of <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec18"><strong>Mission #25: Am I in the House?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">With Python code, you can make cool actions happen when you walk onto a certain area on the map. You could make a secret door open when the player walks onto a specific block, or you could trap them in a box when they walk over a trap. In this mission, I’ll show you how to detect if someone is in your Minecraft house.</p>
<p class="indent">In Mission #8 (<a href="ch03.xhtml#page_59">page 59</a>), you created a program that automatically builds the walls, ceiling, and floor of a building. You saved the program as <em>building.py</em> in the <em>math</em> folder. Open this program.</p>
<p class="indent">Read the code in the <em>building.py</em> program and make a note of the values of the <span class="literal">width</span>, <span class="literal">height</span>, and <span class="literal">length</span> variables (by default the values were <span class="literal">10</span>, <span class="literal">5</span>, and <span class="literal">6</span>, respectively). Also, write down the coordinates that you are currently standing at. Run the building program to build a house.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that you’ve created a building, we can write a program like <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex7">Listing 5-7</a> that checks whether the player is standing inside it.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>insideHouse.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs">   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = minecraft.create()<br/><br/><span class="ent">➊</span> buildX =<br/>   buildY =<br/>   buildZ =<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> width = 10<br/>   height = 5<br/>   length = 6<br/><br/>   pos = mc.player.getTilePos()<br/>   x = pos.x<br/>   y = pos.y<br/>   z = pos.z<br/><br/><span class="ent">➌</span> inside = buildX &lt; x &lt; buildX + width <span class="orange">and</span></p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex7"></a><em>Listing 5-7: The start of the program to check whether the player is inside their house</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex7">Listing 5-7</a> is supposed to check that the player’s x-coordinate is within the building created by <em>building.py,</em> but the program isn’t finished! Your job is to make sure the program also checks the y- and z-coordinates against the coordinates of the house that you built with the <em>building.py</em> program.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"></span>Copy <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5ex7">Listing 5-7</a> into a new file and save it as <em>insideHouse.py</em>. You’ll complete the program so it checks whether the player is inside the building.</p>
<p class="indent">To complete the program, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Add the coordinates of the building (these are the coordinates you were standing at when you ran the <em>building.py</em> program) <span class="ent">➊</span>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Correct the <span class="literal">width</span>, <span class="literal">height</span>, and <span class="literal">length</span> variables if they are different from the ones used in your <em>building.py</em> program <span class="ent">➋</span>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Complete the comparison for the <span class="literal">inside</span> variable so it checks whether the player’s coordinates are inside the building. The first part, to check whether the x position is in the house, has been done for you <span class="ent">➌</span>. You need to add the comparisons for the y and z positions. The expressions are similar to the one that I’ve included for the x position (<span class="literal">buildX &lt; x &lt; buildX + width</span>).</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Post the value of the <span class="literal">inside</span> variable to the chat.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">When you’ve made the changes, save and run the program. You should see output similar to <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig10">Figure 5-10</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec05"><strong><span class="blue1">What You Learned</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you used Booleans, comparators, and logical operators to answer questions in your programs. In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, you’ll write programs that make decisions based on the answers to these questions. You’ll check whether a condition is true or not, and you’ll tell the program to run some code if the condition is true or run different code if it’s false. In <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, your programs will keep running a piece of code as long as a condition is true and stop if the condition becomes false. This is the real power of Booleans and comparators. They help you control which code gets run in your program and exactly when the code gets run.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106"></span></p>
