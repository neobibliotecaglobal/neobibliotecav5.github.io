<p class="noindent">Massive thanks to the fine people at No Starch Press—Riley Hoffman, Hayley Baker, Tyler Ortman, and Jennifer Griffith-Delgado—and the very dedicated technical reviewer John Lutz.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks to David Whale and Martin O’Hanlon who were immensely helpful whenever I had a technical issue. I’d also like to thank Mojang for releasing the Minecraft: Pi Edition (which had the original implementation of the Minecraft Python API) for free. Without the people who dedicate their free time to Spigot and CanaryMod, this book would not have been possible. The same goes for the fine people who updated the Minecraft API to Python 3 and also Alex Bradbury for his work on Raspbian.</p>
<p class="indent">If you ever meet David Whale, Matthew Timmons Brown, David Honess, Rachel Rayns, Andrew Robinson, or Jenny Brennan, give them a round of applause for helping out at Minecraft and Python workshops. Likewise, a round of applause for Tim Richardson, Michael Horne, Alan O’Donohoe, and Laura Dixon for arranging events that helped these workshops reach young people across the country.</p>
<p class="indent">Without Brian Corteil, the Minecraft mission that uses Flask would have been a lot more boring. Charlotte Godley helped immensely by loaning me her Mac so I could write the Mac installation instructions for this book.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, to all my friends, family, and colleagues, I am forever grateful for your support during my various phases of bearded reclusiveness.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xviii"></span></p>
