<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, you learned how to ask questions in Python. You used comparison operators (like <span class="literal">==</span>, <span class="literal">!=</span>, <span class="literal">&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;</span>, and so on) and logical operators (<span class="literal">and</span>, <span class="literal">or</span>, <span class="literal">not</span>) to find out whether a condition or set of conditions evaluated to <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>. In this chapter, you’ll use the answers to these questions—the results of the conditions you test—to decide what code to run.</p>
<p class="indent">You make decisions based on conditions every day. Is it nighttime? If so, you wear your diamond armor and bring a sword to fight off monsters. If not, you might leave all your gear in your secret base. Are you hungry? If that’s true, you eat some bread or an apple. If not, you might go off on a grand adventure to work up an appetite. Just as you make decisions in everyday life, your programs need to do different tasks depending on a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll use a bit of Python code to help your programs make decisions. <span class="literal">if</span> statements tell your program whether or not to run a particular piece of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108"></span>code. An <span class="literal">if</span> statement means “<em>If</em> this condition is true, run this code.” For example, you could check whether the player is standing in a forbidden room and turn the floor to lava if they are. Or, you could check whether they placed a certain block at a certain location and open a hidden door if they did. Using conditions and <span class="literal">if</span> statements, you can begin to make your own mini-games in Minecraft.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec01"><strong><span class="blue1">Using if Statements</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Being able to control the execution of your program is a very powerful ability; in fact, it’s crucial to coding! Programmers sometimes call this concept <em>flow control</em>. The easiest way to add this kind of control is by using the simple <span class="literal">if</span> statement, which runs code when a condition is <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<p class="indentb">An <span class="literal">if</span> statement has three parts:</p>
<p class="bull">• The <span class="literal">if</span> operator</p>
<p class="bull">• A condition to test</p>
<p class="bull">• A body of code to run if the condition is <span class="literal">True</span></p>
<p class="indentt">Let’s look at an <span class="literal">if</span> statement in action. The following code will print <span class="literal">"That's a lot of zombies."</span> only if there are more than 20 zombies. Otherwise, it won’t do anything.</p>
<p class="programs">zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"That's a lot of zombies."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Here, <span class="literal">zombies &gt; 20</span> is the condition we’re testing, and <span class="literal">print("That's a lot of zombies.")</span> is the body of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement; it’s the code that runs if <span class="literal">zombies &gt; 20</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>. The colon (<span class="literal">:</span>) at the end of the <span class="literal">if</span> line tells Python that the next line will start the body of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement. The indentation tells Python which lines of code make up this body. <em>Indentation</em> means there is extra space at the beginning of a line of text. In Python you indent lines by four spaces. If we wanted to add more lines of code to run inside the <span class="literal">if</span> statement, we would put the same number of spaces in front of all of them, indenting them just like <span class="literal">print("That's a lot of zombies.")</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this code a few times, testing each condition, and see what happens. For example, try entering a number that is less than 20, the number 20, and a number that is greater than 20. Here is what happens if you enter 22:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Enter the number of zombies:</span> 22<br/><span class="blue1">That's a lot of zombies.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Okay, the result makes sense. Let’s run it another time and see what happens when the condition isn’t met.</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Enter the number of zombies:</span> 5</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109"></span>Notice that nothing happens if the condition is <span class="literal">False</span>. The body of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement is entirely ignored. An <span class="literal">if</span> statement will execute the code in its body only if the condition is <span class="literal">True</span>. When the <span class="literal">if</span> statement is finished, the program continues on the line after the <span class="literal">if</span> statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at another example to better understand how this works. The following code uses an <span class="literal">if</span> statement to check whether a password is correct:</p>
<p class="programs">password = <span class="green">"cats"</span><br/>attempt = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Please enter the password: "</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if</span> attempt == password:<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is correct"</span>)<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Program finished"</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">The expression after the <span class="literal">if</span> statement is the condition: <span class="literal">attempt == password</span>. The indented line after <span class="literal">if attempt == password:</span> is the <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s body: <span class="literal">print("Password is correct")</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The code will print <span class="literal">"Password is correct"</span> only if the value stored in the <span class="literal">attempt</span> variable is the same as the value in the <span class="literal">password</span> variable. If they are not the same, it will not print anything. The last line will run and print <span class="literal">"Program finished"</span> whether or not the body of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s try something a little more explosive.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch06lev2sec01"><strong>Mission #26: Blast a Crater</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ve already learned how to make the player teleport and jump high. Now you’ll make the blocks around the player disappear.</p>
<p class="indent">When the program runs, the blocks above, below, and around the player will turn into air. This power is very destructive, so be careful when you use it. To be safe, the program will ask the user whether they are sure they want to destroy the blocks, and it will only do so if the user’s answer is yes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6ex1">Listing 6-1</a> creates a crater around the player by deleting all the blocks above, below, and around them. Then it posts <span class="literal">"Boom!"</span> to chat. Save this program as <em>crater.py</em> in a new folder called <em>ifStatements</em>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>crater.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs">   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>   answer = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Create a crater? Y/N "</span>)<br/><br/><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="red"># Add an if statement here</span><br/><br/>   pos = mc.player.getPos()<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> mc.setBlocks(pos.x + 1, pos.y + 1, pos.z + 1, pos.x - 1, pos.y - 1, pos.z - 1, 0)<br/>   mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"Boom!"</span>)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch6ex1"></a><em>Listing 6-1: This code creates a crater, no matter what the user enters.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">answer</span> variable uses the <span class="literal">input()</span> function to ask the user whether they want to create a crater. At the moment, however, the code will create a crater no matter what the user enters—<span class="literal">Y</span>, <span class="literal">N</span>, something else, or nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"></span>To complete this program, you’ll need to add an <span class="literal">if</span> statement to check whether the user has input <span class="literal">Y</span> in response to the question. You can add that logic to the game at <span class="ent">➊</span>. Remember that the user’s response is stored in the <span class="literal">answer</span> variable, so your <span class="literal">if</span> statement should check the <span class="literal">answer</span> variable. After you add your <span class="literal">if</span> statement, the program should only run the last three lines of code when the player inputs <span class="literal">Y</span>. To do this, you must indent these lines by four spaces.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that the very last argument of the <span class="literal">setBlocks()</span> function should be the block type you want to set. Here, the last argument is <span class="literal">0</span>, the block type for air. In other words, the crater is created using <span class="literal">setBlocks()</span> to set the blocks to air <span class="ent">➋</span>, making it look like all the blocks around the player have been destroyed. By adding and subtracting 1 to the values of <span class="literal">pos.x</span>, <span class="literal">pos.y</span>, and <span class="literal">pos.z</span>, the code places air blocks around the player’s position as a 3 by 3 cube. This is the crater.</p>
<p class="indent">After you’ve made the changes to the program, save it and run it. The question <span class="literal">Create a Crater? Y/N</span> will appear in the Python shell. Enter either <span class="literal">Y</span> or <span class="literal">N</span>. Make sure the Y is a capital letter, or the program won’t work properly.</p>
<p class="indent">When the user enters <span class="literal">Y</span>, a crater will appear, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f06-01.jpg"/></div>

<p class="sidebart" id="ch06sb01"><strong>BONUS OBJECTIVE: BUILD A HOUSE</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">What else can you make this program do? Try changing the program to build a house around the player instead of creating a crater.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec02"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111"></span><strong><span class="blue1">else Statements</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll look at a more advanced statement to use if we want to run a <em>different</em> piece of code when the <span class="literal">if</span> condition is <span class="literal">False</span>. That’s where the <span class="literal">else</span> statement comes in.</p>
<p class="indent">An <span class="literal">else</span> statement works together with an <span class="literal">if</span> statement. First you write an <span class="literal">if</span> statement to run some code if the condition is <span class="literal">True</span>. After the <span class="literal">if</span>, you write an <span class="literal">else</span> statement to run other code when the condition evaluates to <span class="literal">False</span>. It’s like you’re saying, “If the condition is true, do this. Otherwise, do something else.”</p>
<p class="indent">The following program will print <span class="literal">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span> if more than 20 zombies are in a room; otherwise, it will print <span class="literal">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span></p>
<p class="programs">zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Like the <span class="literal">if</span> statement, the <span class="literal">else</span> statement uses a colon and indentation to indicate which code belongs to the body of the <span class="literal">else</span> statement. But the <span class="literal">else</span> statement can’t be used by itself; an <span class="literal">if</span> must come before it. The <span class="literal">else</span> statement does not have its own condition; the body of the <span class="literal">else</span> statement runs only if the <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s condition (<span class="literal">zombies &gt; 20</span> in this example) is not <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Going back to the earlier password example, we can add an <span class="literal">else</span> statement to print a message when the password is incorrect, like this:</p>
<p class="programs">password = <span class="green">"cats"</span><br/>attempt = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Please enter the password: "</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if</span> attempt == password:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is correct."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is incorrect."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">When the value of <span class="literal">attempt</span> matches the value of <span class="literal">password</span>, the condition will be <span class="literal">True</span>. The program runs the code that prints <span class="literal">"Password is correct."</span></p>
<p class="indent">When <span class="literal">attempt</span> does not match <span class="literal">password</span>, the condition will be <span class="literal">False</span>. The program runs the code that prints <span class="literal">"Password is incorrect."</span></p>
<p class="indent">What if an <span class="literal">else</span> statement is used without an <span class="literal">if</span> statement? For example, if a program had just these two lines:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Nothing happened."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Python wouldn’t understand what was going on, and you’d get an error.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch06lev2sec03"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"></span><strong>Mission #27: Prevent Smashing, or Not</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In Mission #17 (<a href="ch05.xhtml#page_86">page 86</a>), you made a program that stopped the player from smashing blocks by making the world immutable using <span class="literal">mc.setting("world_immutable", True)</span>. The program helped you protect your precious creations from accidents or vandals. But even though it was useful, the program wasn’t very flexible. Turning it off required a second program, which is pretty inconvenient!</p>
<p class="indent">Using an <span class="literal">if</span> statement, an <span class="literal">else</span> statement, and console input, you can make a program that turns immutable on and off. Your program will ask whether you want the blocks to be immutable and then set immutable to <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span> depending on your response.</p>
<p class="indent">Open IDLE and create a new file. Save the file as <em>immutableChoice.py</em> in the <em>ifStatements</em> folder. Follow these instructions to complete the program:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">The program needs to ask the user whether they want to make the blocks immutable:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="green">"Do you want blocks to be immutable? Y/N"</span></p>
<p class="indent">Add this string as an argument inside <span class="literal">input()</span> and store the input in a variable called <span class="literal">answer</span>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">The program checks whether the value stored in the <span class="literal">answer</span> variable is <span class="literal">"Y"</span>. If it is, it runs the following code:</p>
<p class="programs">mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">True</span>)<br/>mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"World is immutable"</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Copy this code and put it in an <span class="literal">if</span> statement so it runs only if the value of the <span class="literal">answer</span> variable is equal to <span class="literal">"Y"</span>. Don’t forget to indent!</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">The program runs the following code if the <span class="literal">answer</span> variable is not <span class="literal">"Y"</span>.</p>
<p class="programs">mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">False</span>)<br/>mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"World is mutable"</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Copy this code and put it in an indented <span class="literal">else</span> statement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Save and run the program. When it asks whether or not you want to make the blocks immutable, type <span class="literal">Y</span> or <span class="literal">N</span> and press <small>ENTER</small>. Test the program. When you choose to make blocks immutable, they shouldn’t break; otherwise, they should be breakable.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a> shows the output message and question in the shell.

Give it a shot!</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec04"><strong><span class="blue1">elif Statements</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Using an <span class="literal">if</span> statement and an <span class="literal">else</span> statement, your program was able to run some code if a condition was <span class="literal">True</span> and different code if the condition was <span class="literal">False</span>. But what if you want more than two blocks of code to run?</p>
<p class="indent">To do this, you can use an <span class="literal">else-if</span> statement, or <span class="literal">elif</span> in Python. First you write an <span class="literal">if</span> statement, then you write an <span class="literal">elif</span> statement, and then you write an <span class="literal">else</span> statement. When you use these statements together, you’re saying, “If a condition is <span class="literal">True</span>, run this code. Otherwise, if a second, different condition is <span class="literal">True</span>, run some other code. Finally, if neither of those two conditions is <span class="literal">True</span>, run some other code.”</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at it. Say you’re deciding what flavor to buy at the ice cream shop. You might say, “If there’s any chocolate ice cream left, I’ll get that. If there isn’t chocolate, but there’s strawberry, I’ll get strawberry. If there isn’t chocolate or strawberry, I’ll get vanilla.”</p>
<p class="indent">In a program, this decision process looks like this:</p>
<p class="programs">hasChocolate = <span class="orange">False</span><br/>hasStrawberry = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="orange">if</span> hasChocolate:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Hooray! I'm getting chocolate."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">elif</span> hasStrawberry:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I'm getting the second best flavor, strawberry."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Vanilla is OK too, I guess."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"></span>The first two lines just set the stage for the scenario: we’ll assume that today, the ice cream shop doesn’t have any chocolate left but does have strawberry. So we set <span class="literal">hasChocolate</span> to <span class="literal">False</span> and <span class="literal">hasStrawberry</span> to <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Next is the logic of the decision process: an <span class="literal">if</span> statement prints <span class="literal">"Hooray! I'm getting chocolate."</span> if <span class="literal">hasChocolate</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>. But in this example, it’s <span class="literal">False</span>, so that message isn’t printed. Instead, the program goes on to the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement and tests whether <span class="literal">hasStrawberry</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>. Because it is, the code in the body of the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement runs and prints <span class="literal">"I'm getting the second best flavor, strawberry."</span></p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, this <span class="literal">elif</span> statement has its own condition and body. The <span class="literal">elif</span> statement executes only when the condition of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement is <span class="literal">False</span> and the condition of the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement is <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the <span class="literal">else</span> statement after the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement executes when the <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s condition is <span class="literal">False</span> and the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement’s condition is also <span class="literal">False</span>. In this example, the <span class="literal">else</span> statement’s code would run if both <span class="literal">hasChocolate</span> and <span class="literal">hasStrawberry</span> were <span class="literal">False</span>, printing <span class="literal">"Vanilla is OK too, I guess."</span></p>
<p class="indent">For another example, let’s go back to the program that printed <span class="literal">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span> if more than 20 zombies were in a room. We can add an <span class="literal">elif</span> statement to test another condition when the <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s condition is <span class="literal">False</span>:</p>
<p class="programs">zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">elif</span> zombies == 0:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"No zombies here! Phew!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">We add an <span class="literal">elif</span> statement to compare <span class="literal">zombies</span> and 0. If <span class="literal">zombies == 0</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>, the code in the <span class="literal">elif</span> statement’s body prints <span class="literal">"No zombies here! Phew!"</span> If this <span class="literal">elif</span> statement’s condition is <span class="literal">False</span>, the code moves on to the <span class="literal">else</span> statement and prints <span class="literal">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span></p>

<p class="noindent">There is no limit to the number of <span class="literal">elif</span> statements that you can include with an <span class="literal">if</span> statement. You can have one <span class="literal">elif</span> statement or 100 <span class="literal">elif</span> statements. Python just evaluates them one after the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example using the “number of zombies” program:</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117"></span>The order of the <span class="literal">if</span> and <span class="literal">elif</span> statements is very important.

<p class="indent">Why is this wrong? Let’s look at what happens when <span class="literal">zombies</span> is, say, 22. Because 22 is greater than 10, the first <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s condition, <span class="literal">zombies &gt; 10</span>, is <span class="literal">True</span>, and the <span class="literal">if</span> statement’s code runs.

<p class="noindent">As you learned in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, you can determine whether one value is between two other values in Python. Because a range check evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>, you can use a range check as the condition in an <span class="literal">if</span> statement, just like you’d use a simple less than/greater than or equal to/not equal to comparison. Any expression that evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span> can be a condition of an <span class="literal">if</span> statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Say you’ve spent all day gathering ingredients to bake some delicious Minecraft cakes. You find enough ingredients to bake 30 cakes, and now you want to sell the cakes. The person buying cakes from you must buy 1 cake but less than 30; otherwise, you won’t sell cakes to that person. They can’t hog all the cakes!</p>
<p class="indent">This code represents the cake situation:</p>
<p class="programs">   cakes = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of cakes to buy: "</span>))<br/><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="orange">if</span> 0 &lt; cakes &lt; 30:<br/>       <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Here are your "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(cakes) + <span class="green">" cakes."</span>)<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> <span class="orange">elif</span> cakes == 0:<br/>       print(<span class="green">"Don't you want some delicious cake?"</span>)<br/><span class="ent">➌</span> <span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>       <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"That's too many cakes! Don't be selfish!"</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">If the <span class="literal">cakes</span> variable has a value between 0 and 30, such as 15, we print <span class="literal">"Here are your 15 cakes."</span> <span class="ent">➊</span>. Otherwise, we print a different message. If <span class="literal">cakes</span> has a value of 0, we print <span class="literal">"Don't you want some delicious cake?"</span> <span class="ent">➋</span> and if it’s greater than 30, we print <span class="literal">"That's too many cakes! Don't be selfish!"</span> <span class="ent">➌</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">We can test a more complicated expression by adding a Boolean operator. If I was really weird and didn’t want people to buy a quantity of bread between 20 and 30, I could do this using the <span class="literal">not</span> operator:</p>
<p class="programs">bread = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the amount of bread: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if not</span> 20 &lt;= bread &lt;= 30:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Here are your "</span> + bread + <span class="green">" breads."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I don't sell that amount of bread for some reason."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">Here I use a <span class="literal">not</span> operator and the greater than or equal to comparisons to test a range of values as the first condition. The range check determines whether the amount of bread people want to buy is between 20 and 30. Then, the <span class="literal">not</span> flips a <span class="literal">True</span> to <span class="literal">False</span> and a <span class="literal">False</span> to <span class="literal">True</span>. So if <span class="literal">bread</span> is in the range, the overall expression evaluates to <span class="literal">False</span>, and we run the code in the <span class="literal">else</span> statement. If <span class="literal">bread</span> is not in the range between 20 and 30—say it’s 40— the overall expression is <span class="literal">True</span>, and we print <span class="literal">"Here are your 40 breads."</span></p>
<p class="indent">If someone tries to buy 23 breads, I won’t let them. But 17 or 32 is just fine.</p>

In this mission, you’ll use range checks and <span class="literal">if</span> statements to limit where the player can teleport to. If you’re using Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi, there are places outside the game world that don’t exist, but your program will still let you teleport to them. If you’re using the desktop edition of Minecraft, your world is much bigger, so you don’t have the same restrictions as in the Pi edition of the game, but this program is still useful.

We ask the user to input values for <span class="literal">x</span>, <span class="literal">y</span>, and <span class="literal">z</span>. Then we have an <span class="literal">if</span> statement check whether the <span class="literal">x</span> variable is not between −127 and 127.

Y/N"</span>)<br/>wouldShare = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Would you give me some cake? Y/N"</span>)<br/><br/><span class="orange">if</span> hasCake == <span class="green">"Y"</span> <span class="orange">or</span> wouldShare == <span class="green">"Y"</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Yay!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Boo!"</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">If either <span class="literal">hasCake == "Y"</span> or <span class="literal">wouldShare == "Y"</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>, the whole expression evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>, and we print <span class="literal">"Yay!"</span> The only time we print <span class="literal">"Boo!"</span> is if neither condition is <span class="literal">True</span>: the person doesn’t have cake and wouldn’t share it if they did.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using the <span class="literal">not</span> operator with an <span class="literal">if</span> statement:</p>
<p class="programs">wearingShoes = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Are you wearing shoes? Y/N"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if not</span> wearingShoes == <span class="green">"Y"</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You're not wearing shoes."</span>)</p>
<p class="indent">This program asks the user to enter <span class="literal">Y</span> if they are wearing shoes and <span class="literal">N</span> if they aren’t. It stores the input in <span class="literal">wearingShoes</span>. Next is a comparison between <span class="literal">wearingShoes</span> and <span class="literal">"Y"</span> to see whether they’re equal. The <span class="literal">not</span> operator reverses the result of a comparison—<span class="literal">True</span> becomes <span class="literal">False</span> and <span class="literal">False</span> becomes <span class="literal">True</span>—so if the user entered <span class="literal">Y</span>, the comparison starts off <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">not</span> makes it <span class="literal">False</span>, making the overall expression <span class="literal">False</span>. We don’t print a message. If the user didn’t enter <span class="literal">Y</span>, the comparison is <span class="literal">False</span> and <span class="literal">not</span> makes it <span class="literal">True</span>. The overall expression evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>, and we print <span class="literal">"You're not wearing shoes."</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The best Minecraft houses have a lot of attention to detail. Many people include wooden flooring, fireplaces, and pictures in their houses to make them feel more like home. You’ll go one step further and make a working shower.</p>
<p class="indent">To get the shower to work, you need to use range checks and Boolean operators. You’ll create a shower area, and when the player walks into the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"></span>shower, the water will switch on. In other words, when the player walks within a range of coordinates, the program should create water blocks above them.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6ex7">Listing 6-7</a> provides the basic structure of the program with a few lines of code to help you get started. It’s your job to fill in the rest.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>shower.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs">   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/><span class="ent">➊</span> shwrX =<br/>   shwrY =<br/>   shwrZ =<br/><br/><span class="ent">➋</span> width = 5<br/>   height = 5<br/>   length = 5<br/><br/>   pos = mc.player.getTilePos()<br/>   x = pos.x<br/>   y = pos.y<br/>   z = pos.z<br/><br/><span class="ent">➌</span> <span class="orange">if</span> shwrX &lt;= x &lt; shwrX + width <span class="orange">and</span><br/>       mc.setBlocks(shwrX, shwrY + height, shwrZ,<br/>                    shwrX + width, shwrY + height, shwrZ + length, 8)<br/>   <span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>       mc.setBlocks(shwrX, shwrY + height, shwrZ,<br/><span class="ent">➍</span>                  shwrX + width, shwrY + height, shwrZ + length, 0)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch6ex7"></a><em>Listing 6-7: The start of the shower program</em></p>
<p class="indent">Copy <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6ex7">Listing 6-7</a> and save it as <em>shower.py</em> in the <em>ifStatements</em> folder.</p>
<p class="indent">To finish the program, add the coordinates for your shower in the <span class="literal">shwrX</span>, <span class="literal">shwrY</span>, and <span class="literal">shwrZ</span> variables <span class="ent">➊</span>. Next, add the size of the shower in the <span class="literal">width</span>, <span class="literal">height</span>, and <span class="literal">length</span> variables <span class="ent">➋</span>. I’ve included a default value of 5, but you should change this to make your shower the size you want it to be.</p>
<p class="indent">Finish the <span class="literal">if</span> statement so it checks whether the <span class="literal">y</span> and <span class="literal">z</span> variables are within the shower area <span class="ent">➌</span>. I’ve included the check for the <span class="literal">x</span> position to help you out (<span class="literal">shwrX &lt; x &lt; shwrX + width</span>). The expressions for the <span class="literal">y</span> and <span class="literal">z</span> positions are similar to this. Hint: You’ll want to combine all these checks using <span class="literal">and</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The shower is switched on and off using the <span class="literal">setBlocks()</span> function <span class="ent">➍</span>. The blocks are set to water (block ID 8) to switch on the shower and air (block ID 0) to switch off the shower.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">setBlocks()</span> functions in the last <span class="literal">if</span>/<span class="literal">else</span> statement are broken across two lines because their arguments are very long. Python allows you to do this. They could be written on a single line; I wrote them on two lines just to make them easier to read.</p>

<p class="indent">When you run the program, it will create water above you if you’re standing in the shower. The water will not stop until you leave the shower and run the program again. Have fun!</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec04"><strong><span class="blue1">What You Learned</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Your programs can now make decisions. In this chapter, you learned how to use conditions with <span class="literal">if</span> statements, <span class="literal">else</span> statements, and <span class="literal">elif</span> statements. In <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, you’ll learn about <em>while loops</em>. Like <span class="literal">if</span> statements, <span class="literal">while</span> loops help your program decide what to do and when. But unlike <span class="literal">if</span> and <span class="literal">else</span> statements—which you use to run some code if a condition is true and different code if it’s not true—<span class="literal">while</span> loops run code <em>while</em> a condition is true and keep running it repeatedly until the condition becomes false.</p>
