<p class="noindent">I would like to thank everyone at No Starch Press for making this book possible. From the first emails discussing the book idea with Bill Pollock and Tyler Ortman, through the rest of the process, everyone there has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Seph Kramer was amazing with his technical insights and suggestions and Riley Hoffman was meticulous in checking and re-checking that everything was correct. It is only fair to say that without these two fine people, this book wouldnâ€™t have been close to what it is. Thanks to Jeremy Kun and Otis Chodosh for their insights and making sure all the math made sense. I would also like to thank the copyeditor, Julianne Jigour, for her thoroughness.</p>
<p class="indent">SymPy forms a core part of many chapters in this book and I would like to thank everyone on the SymPy mailing list for answering my queries patiently and reviewing my patches with promptness. I would also like to thank the matplotlib community for answering and clearing up my doubts.</p>
<p class="indent">I would like to thank David Ash for lending me his Macbook, which helped me when writing the software installation instructions.</p>
<p class="indent">I also must thank every writer and thinker who inspired me to write, from humble web pages to my favorite books.<a id="page_xiv"></a></p>
