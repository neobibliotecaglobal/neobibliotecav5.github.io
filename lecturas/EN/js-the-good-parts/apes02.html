A
                JSON text can be turned into a useful data structure with the <code class="literal">eval</code> function:<a id="IDX-APP-E-0699" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-E-0700" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-E-0701" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e11235"/><pre class="programlisting">var myData = eval('(' + myJSONText + ')');</pre><p>(The concatenation of the parentheses around the JSON text is a workaround for an
                ambiguity in JavaScript's grammar.)</p><p>The <code class="literal">eval</code> function has horrendous security
                problems, however. Is it safe to use <code class="literal">eval</code> to
                parse a JSON text? Currently, the best technique for obtaining data from a server in
                a web browser is through <code class="literal">XMLHttpRequest</code>. <code class="literal">XMLHttpRequest</code> can obtain data only from the same
                server that produced the HTML. <code class="literal">eval</code> ing text from
                that server is no less secure than the original HTML. But, that assumes the server
                is malicious. What if the server is simply incompetent?<a id="IDX-APP-E-0702" class="indexterm"/></p><p>An incompetent server might not do the JSON encoding correctly. If it builds JSON
                texts by slapping together some strings rather than using a proper JSON encoder,
                then it could unintentionally send dangerous material. If it acts as a proxy and
                simply passes JSON text through without determining whether it is well formed, then
                it could send dangerous material again.</p><p>The danger can be avoided by using the <code class="literal">JSON.parse</code> method instead of <code class="literal">eval</code>
                (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.JSON.org/json2.js">http://www.JSON.org/json2.js</a>). <code class="literal">JSON.parse</code> will throw an exception if the text contains anything
                dangerous. It is recommended that you always use <code class="literal">JSON.parse</code> instead of <code class="literal">eval</code> to
                defend against server incompetence. It is also good practice for the day when the
                browser provides safe data access to other servers.</p><p>There is another danger in the interaction between external data and <code class="literal">innerHTML</code>. A common Ajax pattern is for the server to
                send an HTML text fragment that gets assigned to the <code class="literal">innerHTML</code> property of an HTML element. This is a very bad practice.
                If the HTML text contains a <code class="literal">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag or
                its equivalent, then an evil script will run. This again could be due to server
                incompetence.</p><p>What specifically is the danger? If an evil script gets to run on your page, it
                gets access to all of the state and capabilities of the page. It can interact with
                your server, and your server will not be able to distinguish the evil requests from
                legitimate requests. The evil script has access to the global object, which gives it
                access to all of the data in the application except for variables hidden in
                closures. It has access to the document object, which gives it access to everything
                that the user sees. It also gives the evil script the capability to dialog with the
                user. The browser's location bar and all of the anti-phishing chrome will tell the
                user that the dialog should be trusted. The document object also gives the evil
                script access to the network, allowing it to load more evil scripts, or to probe for
                sites within your firewall, or to send the secrets it has learned to any server in
                the world.<a id="IDX-APP-E-0703" class="indexterm"/></p><p>This danger is a direct consequence of JavaScript's global object, which is far
                and away the worst part of JavaScript's many bad parts. These dangers are not caused
                by Ajax or JSON or <code class="literal">XMLHttpRequest</code> or Web 2.0
                (whatever that is). These dangers have been in the browser since the introduction of
                JavaScript, and will remain until JavaScript is replaced or repaired. Be
                careful.</p></div></body></html>
