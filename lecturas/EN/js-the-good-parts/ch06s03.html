                    array:<a id="IDX-CHP-6-0301" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0302" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0303" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0304" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-6-0305" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting6_d1e4500"/><pre class="programlisting">delete numbers[2];
// numbers is ['zero', 'one', undefined, 'shi', 'go']</pre><p>Unfortunately, that leaves a hole in the array. This is because the elements to
                the right of the deleted element retain their original names. What you usually want
                is to decrement the names of each of the elements to the right.</p><p>Fortunately, JavaScript arrays have a <code class="literal">splice</code>
                method. It can do surgery on an array, deleting some number of elements and
                replacing them with other elements. The first argument is an ordinal in the array.
                The second argument is the number of elements to delete. Any additional arguments
                get inserted into the array at that point:</p><a id="I_programlisting6_d1e4509"/><pre class="programlisting">numbers.splice(2, 1);
// numbers is ['zero', 'one', 'shi', 'go']</pre><p>The property whose value is <code class="literal">'shi'</code> has its key
                changed from <code class="literal">'3'</code> to <code class="literal">'2'</code>. Because every property after the deleted property must be
                removed and reinserted with a new key, this might not go quickly for large
                arrays.</p></div></body></html>
