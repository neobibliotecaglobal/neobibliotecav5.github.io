                determine at compile time if property names are spelled correctly. JSLint provides
                some assistance with this.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0592" class="indexterm"/></p><p>At the bottom of its report, JSLint displays a <code class="literal">/*members*/</code> comment. It contains all of the names and string literals
                that were used with dot notation, subscript notation, and object literals to name
                the members of objects. You can look through the list for misspellings. Member names
                that were used only once are shown in italics. This is to make misspellings easier
                to spot.</p><p>You can copy the <code class="literal">/*members*/</code> comment into your
                script file. JSLint will check the spelling of all property names against the list.
                That way, you can have JSLint look for misspellings for you:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e9500"/><pre class="programlisting">/*members doTell, iDoDeclare, mercySakes,
