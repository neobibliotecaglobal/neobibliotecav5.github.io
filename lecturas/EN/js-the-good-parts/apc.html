                Errors</em></span></span></span></div></div><p>When C was a young programming language, there were several common programming errors
            that were not caught by the primitive compilers, so an accessory program called <code class="literal">lint</code> was developed that would scan a source file, looking
            for problems.</p><p>As C matured, the definition of the language was strengthened to eliminate some
            insecurities, and compilers got better at issuing warnings. <code class="literal">lint</code> is no longer needed.</p><p>JavaScript is a young-for-its-age language. It was originally intended to do small
            tasks in web pages, tasks for which Java was too heavy and clumsy. But JavaScript is a
            very capable language, and it is now being used in larger projects. Many of the features
            that were intended to make the language easy to use are troublesome for larger projects.
            A <code class="literal">lint</code> for JavaScript is needed: JSLint, a JavaScript
            syntax checker and verifier.</p><p>JSLint is a code quality tool for JavaScript. It takes a source text and scans it. If
            it finds a problem, it returns a message describing the problem and an approximate
            location within the source. The problem is not necessarily a syntax error, although it
            often is. JSLint looks at some style conventions as well as structural problems. It does
            not prove that your program is correct. It just provides another set of eyes to help
            spot problems.</p><p>JSLint defines a professional subset of JavaScript, a stricter language than that
            defined by the third edition of the <span class="emphasis"><em>ECMAScript Language
                Specification</em></span>. The subset is closely related to the style recommendations
            from <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Style">Chapter 9</a>.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0583" class="indexterm"/></p><p>JavaScript is a sloppy language, but inside it there is an elegant, better language.
            JSLint helps you to program in that better language and to avoid most of the
            slop.</p><p>JSLint can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.JSLint.com/">http://www.JSLint.com/</a>.</p><div class="sect1" title="Undefined Variables and Functions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="undefined_variables_and_functions"/>Undefined Variables and Functions</h1></div></div></div><p>JavaScript's biggest problem is its dependence on global variables, particularly
                implied global variables. If a variable is not explicitly declared (usually with the
                    <code class="literal">var</code> statement), then JavaScript assumes that
                the variable was global. This can mask misspelled names and other
                    problems.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0584" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0585" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0586" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0587" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0588" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0589" class="indexterm"/></p><p>JSLint expects that all variables and functions will be declared before they are
                used or invoked. This allows it to detect implied global variables. It is also good
                practice because it makes programs easier to read.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0590" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-C-0591" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Sometimes a file is dependent on global variables and functions that are defined
                elsewhere. You can identify these to JSLint by including a comment in your file that
                lists the global functions and objects that your program depends on, but that are
                not defined in your program or script file.</p><p>A global declaration comment can be used to list all of the names that you are
                intentionally using as global variables. JSLint can use this information to identify
                misspellings and forgotten <code class="literal">var</code> declarations. A
                global declaration can look like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e9444"/><pre class="programlisting">/*global getElementByAttribute, breakCycles, hanoi */</pre><p>A global declaration starts with <code class="literal">/*global</code>.
                Notice that there is no space before the <code class="literal">g</code>. You
                can have as many <code class="literal">/*global</code> comments as you like.
                They must appear before the use of the variables they specify.</p><p>Some globals can be predefined for you (see the later section "<a class="xref" href="apcs03.html" title="Options">Options</a>"). Select the "Assume a browser" (<code class="literal">browser</code>) option to predefine the standard global properties that are
                supplied by web browsers, such as <code class="literal">window</code> and
                    <code class="literal">document</code> and <code class="literal">alert</code>. Select the "Assume Rhino" (<code class="literal">rhino</code>) option to predefine the global properties provided by the
                Rhino environment. Select the "Assume a Yahoo Widget" (<code class="literal">widget</code>) option to predefine the global properties provided by the
                Yahoo! Widgets environment.</p></div></div></body></html>
