                integers. It only has double precision floating-point numbers. So, the bitwise
                operators convert their number operands into integers, do their business, and then
                convert them back. In most languages, these operators are very close to the hardware
                and very fast. In JavaScript, they are very far from the hardware and very slow.
                JavaScript is rarely used for doing bit manipulation.</p><p>As a result, in JavaScript programs, it is more likely that <code class="literal">&amp;</code> is a mistyped <code class="literal">&amp;&amp;</code> operator. The presence of the bitwise operators reduces
                some of the language's redundancy, making it easier for bugs to hide.</p></div></body></html>
