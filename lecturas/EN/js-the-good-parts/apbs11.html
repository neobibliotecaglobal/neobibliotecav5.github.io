                that inherits from the operand's prototype member, and then calls the operand,
                binding the new object to <code class="literal">this</code>. This gives the
                operand (which had better be a constructor function) a chance to customize the new
                object before it is returned to the requestor.</p><p>If you forget to use the <code class="literal">new</code> operator, you
                instead get an ordinary function call, and <code class="literal">this</code>
                is bound to the global object instead of to a new object. That means that your
                function will be clobbering global variables when it attempts to initialize the new
                members. That is a very bad thing. There is no compile-time warning. There is no
                runtime warning.</p><p>By convention, functions that are intended to be used with <code class="literal">new</code> should be given names with initial capital
                letters, and names with initial capital letters should be used only with constructor
                functions that take the <code class="literal">new</code> prefix. This
                convention gives us a visual cue that can help spot expensive mistakes that the
                language itself is keen to overlook.</p><p>An even better coping strategy is to not use <code class="literal">new</code> at all.</p></div></body></html>
