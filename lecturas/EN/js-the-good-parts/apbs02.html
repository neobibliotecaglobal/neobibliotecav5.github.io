                intended to provide a shorthand when accessing the properties of an object.
                Unfortunately, its results can sometimes be unpredictable, so it should be
                    avoided.<a id="IDX-APP-B-0543" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0544" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0545" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-B-0546" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The statement:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e8895"/><pre class="programlisting">with (obj) {
    a = b;
}</pre><p>does the same thing as:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e8899"/><pre class="programlisting">if (obj.a === undefined) {
    a = obj.b === undefined ? b : obj.b;
} else {
    obj.a = obj.b === undefined ? b : obj.b;
}</pre><p>So, it is the same as one of these statements:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e8903"/><pre class="programlisting">a = b;
a = obj.b;
obj.a = b;
obj.a = obj.b;</pre><p>It is not possible to tell from reading the program which of those statements you
                will get. It can vary from one running of the program to the next. It can even vary
                while the program is running. If you can't read a program and understand what it is
                going to do, it is impossible to have confidence that it will correctly do what you
                want.</p><p>Simply by being in the language, the <code class="literal">with</code>
                statement significantly slows down JavaScript processors because it frustrates the
                lexical binding of variable names. It was well intentioned, but the language would
                be better if it didn't have it.</p></div></body></html>
