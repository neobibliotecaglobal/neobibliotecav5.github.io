It got almost
            everything right. But, as you should expect with JavaScript, it didn't get everything
            right.</p><p>A function encloses a set of statements. Functions are the fundamental modular unit of
            JavaScript. They are used for code reuse, information hiding, and composition. Functions
            are used to specify the behavior of objects. Generally, the craft of programming is the
            factoring of a set of requirements into a set of functions and data
                structures.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0184" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sect1" title="Function Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="function_objects"/>Function Objects</h1></div></div></div><p>Functions in JavaScript are objects. Objects are collections of name/value pairs
                having a hidden link to a prototype object. Objects produced from object literals
                are linked to <code class="literal">Object.prototype</code>. Function objects
                are linked to <code class="literal">Function.prototype</code> (which is itself
                linked to <code class="literal">Object.prototype</code>). Every function is
                also created with two additional hidden properties: the function's context and the
                code that implements the function's behavior.</p><p>Every function object is also created with a <code class="literal">prototype</code> property. Its value is an object with a <code class="literal">constructor</code> property whose value is the function. This
                is distinct from the hidden link to <code class="literal">Function.prototype</code>. The meaning of this convoluted construction will
                be revealed in the next chapter.</p><p>Since functions are objects, they can be used like any other value. Functions can
                be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to
                functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Also, since functions are
                objects, functions can have methods.</p><p>The thing that is special about functions is that they can be invoked.</p></div></div></body></html>
