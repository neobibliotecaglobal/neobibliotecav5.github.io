                0.2 is not equal to 0.3. This is the most frequently reported bug in JavaScript, and
                it is an intentional consequence of having adopted the IEEE Standard for Binary
                Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754). This standard is well-suited for many
                applications, but it violates most of the things you learned about numbers in middle
                school. Fortunately, integer arithmetic in floating point is exact, so decimal
                representation errors can be avoided by scaling.<a id="IDX-APP-A-0519" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0520" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For example, dollar values can be converted to whole cents values by multiplying
                them by 100. The cents then can be accurately added. The sum can be divided by 100
                to convert back into dollars. People have a reasonable expectation when they count
                money that the results will be exact.</p></div></body></html>
