// in it that adds two numbers.

var add = <strong class="userinput"><code>function (a, b) {</code></strong>
<span class="strong"><strong>    return a + b;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>};</strong></span></pre><p>A function literal has four parts. The first part is the reserved word <code class="literal">function</code>.</p><p>The optional second part is the function's name. The function can use its name to
                call itself recursively. The name can also be used by debuggers and development
                tools to identify the function. If a function is not given a name, as shown in the
                previous example, it is said to be <span class="emphasis"><em>anonymous</em></span>.</p><p>The third part is the set of parameters of the function, wrapped in parentheses.
                Within the parentheses is a set of zero or more parameter names, separated by
                commas. These names will be defined as variables in the function. Unlike ordinary
                variables, instead of being initialized to <code class="literal">undefined</code>, they will be initialized to the arguments supplied when
                the function is invoked.</p><p>The fourth part is a set of statements wrapped in curly braces. These statements
                are the body of the function. They are executed when the function is invoked.</p><p>A function literal can appear anywhere that an expression can appear. Functions
                can be defined inside of other functions. An inner function of course has access to
                its parameters and variables. An inner function also enjoys access to the parameters
                and variables of the functions it is nested within. The function object created by a
                function literal contains a link to that outer context. This is called
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>closure</em></span>. This is the source of enormous expressive
                power.</p></div></body></html>
