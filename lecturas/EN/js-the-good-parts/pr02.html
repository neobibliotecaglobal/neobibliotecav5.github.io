                our end.</p><div class="attribution"><span>â€”<span class="attribution">William Shakespeare, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Midsummer Night's

            programmers who, by happenstance or curiosity, are venturing into JavaScript for the
            first time. It is also intended for programmers who have been working with JavaScript at
            a novice level and are now ready for a more sophisticated relationship with the
            language. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful language. Its unconventionality presents
            some challenges, but being a small language, it is easily mastered.</p><p>My goal here is to help you to learn to think in JavaScript. I will show you the
            components of the language and start you on the process of discovering the ways those
            components can be put together. This is not a reference book. It is not exhaustive about
            the language and its quirks. It doesn't contain everything you'll ever need to know.
            That stuff you can easily find online. Instead, this book just contains the things that
            are really important.</p><p>This is not a book for beginners. Someday I hope to write a <span class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The
                First Parts</em></span> book, but this is not that book. This is not a book about
            Ajax or web programming. The focus is exclusively on JavaScript, which is just one of
            the languages the web developer must master.</p><p>This is not a book for dummies. This book is small, but it is dense. There is a lot of
            material packed into it. Don't be discouraged if it takes multiple readings to get it.
            Your efforts will be rewarded.</p><div class="sect1" title="Conventions Used in This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="conventions_used_in_this_book"/>Conventions Used in This Book</h1></div></div></div><p>The following typographical conventions are used in this book:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">
