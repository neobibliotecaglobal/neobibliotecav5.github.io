            Tiger butterfly (<span class="emphasis"><em>Danaus chrysippus</em></span>). Outside of Asia, the insect is
            also known as the African Monarch. It is a medium-size butterfly characterized by bright
            orange wings with six black spots and alternating black-and-white stripes.</p><p>Its striking looks have been noted for millennia by scientists and artists. The writer
            Vladimir Nabokov—who was also a noted lepidopterist—had admiring words for the butterfly
            in an otherwise scathing <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> book review of Alice Ford's
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Audubon's Butterflies, Moths, and Other Studies</em></span> (The Studio
            Publications). In the book, Ford labels drawings made previous to and during Audubon's
            time in the 19th century as "scientifi-cally [<span class="emphasis"><em>sic</em></span>]
            unsophisticated."</p><p>In response to Ford, Nabokov writes, "The unsophistication is all her own. She might
            have looked up John Abbot's prodigious representations of North American lepidoptera,
            1797, or the splendid plates of 18th- and early-19th-century German lepidopterists. She
            might have traveled back some 33 centuries to the times of Tuthmosis IV or Amenophis III
            and, instead of the obvious scarab, found there frescoes with a marvelous Egyptian
            butterfly (subtly combining the pattern of our Painted Lady and the body of an African
            ally of the Monarch)."</p><p>While the Plain Tiger's beauty is part of its charm, its looks can also be deadly.
            During its larval stages, the butterfly ingests alkaloids that are poisonous to
            birds—its main predator—which are often attracted to the insect's markings. After
            ingesting the Plain Tiger, a bird will vomit repeatedly—occasionally fatally. If the
            bird lives, it will let other birds know to avoid the insect, which can also be
            recognized by its leisurely, meandering pattern of flying low to the earth.</p><p>The cover image is from <span class="emphasis"><em>Dover's Animals</em></span>. The cover font is Adobe
