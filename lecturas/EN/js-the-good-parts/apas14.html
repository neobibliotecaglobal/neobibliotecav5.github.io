                the prototype chain. Sometimes that matters. For example, suppose you are writing a
                program that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text. We can use the
                    <code class="literal">toLowerCase</code> method to normalize the text to
                lowercase, and then use the <code class="literal">split</code> method with a
                regular expression to produce an array of words. We can then loop through the words
                and count the number of times we see each one:<a id="IDX-APP-A-0536" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e8735"/><pre class="programlisting">var i;
var word;
var text =
        "This oracle of comfort has so pleased me, " +
        "That when I am in heaven I shall desire " +
        "To see what this child does, " +
        "and praise my Constructor.";

var words = text.toLowerCase(  ).split(/[\s,.]+/);
var count = {};
for (i = 0; i &lt; words.length; i += 1) {
    word = words[i];
    if (count[word]) {
        count[word] += 1;
    } else {
        count[word] = 1;
    }
}</pre><p>If we look at the results, <code class="literal">count['this']</code> is 2
                and <code class="literal">count.heaven</code> is 1, but <code class="literal">count.constructor</code> contains a crazy looking string. The
                reason is that the <code class="literal">count</code> object inherits from
                    <code class="literal">Object.prototype</code>, and <code class="literal">Object.prototype</code> contains a member named <code class="literal">constructor</code> whose value is <code class="literal">Object</code>. The <code class="literal">+=</code> operator, like the
                    <code class="literal">+</code> operator, does concatenation rather than
                addition when its operands are not numbers. <code class="literal">Object</code> is a function, so <code class="literal">+=</code>
                converts it to a string somehow and concatenates a 1 to its butt.</p><p>We can avoid problems like this the same way we avoid problems with <code class="literal">for in</code>: by testing for membership with the <code class="literal">hasOwnProperty</code> method or by looking for specific
                types. In this case, our test for the truthiness of <code class="literal">count[word]</code> was not specific enough. We could have written
                instead:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e8788"/><pre class="programlisting">if (typeof count[word] === 'number') {</pre></div></body></html>
