In all other C-like languages, a block (a set of
                statements wrapped in curly braces) creates a scope. Variables declared in a block
                are not visible outside of the block. JavaScript uses the block syntax, but does not
                provide block scope: a variable declared in a block is visible everywhere in the
                function containing the block. This can be surprising to programmers with experience
                in other languages.<a id="IDX-APP-A-0504" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-APP-A-0505" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In most languages, it is generally best to declare variables at the site of first
                use. That turns out to be a bad practice in JavaScript because it does not have
                block scope. It is better to declare all variables at the top of each
                function.</p></div></body></html>
