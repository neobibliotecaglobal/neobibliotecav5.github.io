                privacy. All properties of an object are visible. We get no private variables and no
                private methods. Sometimes that doesn't matter, but sometimes it matters a lot. In
                frustration, some uninformed programmers have adopted a pattern of <span class="emphasis"><em>pretend
                    privacy</em></span>. If they have a property that they wish to make private, they
                give it an odd-looking name, with the hope that other users of the code will pretend
                that they cannot see the odd looking members. Fortunately, we have a much better
                alternative in an application of the module pattern.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0277" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0278" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0279" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0280" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0281" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0282" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0283" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0284" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0285" class="indexterm"/></p><p>We start by making a function that will produce objects. We will give it a name
                that starts with a lowercase letter because it will not require the use of the
                    <code class="literal">new</code> prefix. The function contains four
                steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It creates a new object. There are lots of ways to make an object. It can
                        make an object literal, or it can call a constructor function with the
                            <code class="literal">new</code> prefix, or it can use the
                            <code class="literal">Object.create</code> method to make a new
                        instance from an existing object, or it can call any function that returns
                        an object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It optionally defines private instance variables and methods. These are
                        just ordinary <code class="literal">var</code>s of the
                        function.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It augments that new object with methods. Those methods will have
                        privileged access to the parameters and the <code class="literal">var</code>s defined in the second step.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It returns that new object.</p></li></ol></div><p>Here is a pseudocode template for a functional constructor (boldface text added
                for emphasis):</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4004"/><pre class="programlisting">var <strong class="userinput"><code>constructor</code></strong> = function (spec, my) {
    var that, <strong class="userinput"><code>other private instance variables</code></strong>;
    my = my || {};

    <span class="strong"><strong>Add shared variables and functions to my</strong></span>

    that = <strong class="userinput"><code>a new object</code></strong>;

    <span class="strong"><strong>Add privileged methods to that</strong></span>

    return that;
};</pre><p>The <code class="literal">spec</code> object contains all of the information
                that the constructor needs to make an instance. The contents of the <code class="literal">spec</code> could be copied into private variables or
                transformed by other functions. Or the methods can access information from <code class="literal">spec</code> as they need it. (A simplification is to replace
                    <code class="literal">spec</code> with a single value. This is useful when
                the object being constructed does not need a whole <code class="literal">spec</code> object.)</p><p>The <code class="literal">my</code> object is a container of secrets that
                are shared by the constructors in the inheritance chain. The use of the <code class="literal">my</code> object is optional. If a <code class="literal">my</code> object is not passed in, then a <code class="literal">my</code> object is made.</p><p>Next, declare the private instance variables and private methods for the object.
                This is done by simply declaring variables. The variables and inner functions of the
                constructor become the private members of the instance. The inner functions have
                access to <code class="literal">spec</code> and <code class="literal">my</code> and <code class="literal">that</code> and the private
                    variables.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0286" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Next, add the shared secrets to the <code class="literal">my</code> object.
                This is done by assignment:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4071"/><pre class="programlisting">my.<strong class="userinput"><code>member</code></strong> = <strong class="userinput"><code>value</code></strong>;</pre><p>Now, we make a new object and assign it to <code class="literal">that</code>. There are lots of ways to make a new object. We can use an object
                literal. We can call a pseudoclassical constructor with the <code class="literal">new</code> operator. We can use the <code class="literal"><code class="literal">Object.</code>create</code> method on a prototype
                object. Or, we can call another functional constructor, passing it a <code class="literal">spec</code> object (possibly the same <code class="literal">spec</code> object that was passed to this constructor) and
                the <code class="literal">my</code> object. The <code class="literal">my</code> object allows the other constructor to share the material that we
                put into <code class="literal">my</code>. The other constructor may also put
                its own shared secrets into <code class="literal">my</code> so that our
                constructor can take advantage of it.</p><p>Next, we augment <code class="literal">that</code>, adding the privileged
                methods that make up the object's interface. We can assign new functions to members
                of <code class="literal">that</code>. Or, more securely, we can define the
                functions first as private methods, and then assign them to <code class="literal">that</code>:<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0287" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4124"/><pre class="programlisting">var methodical = function (  ) {
    ...
};
that.methodical = methodical;</pre><p>The advantage to defining <code class="literal">methodical</code> in two
                steps is that if other methods want to call <code class="literal">methodical</code>, they can call <code class="literal">methodical(
                    )</code> instead of <code class="literal">that.methodical( )</code>. If
                the instance is damaged or tampered with so that <code class="literal">that.methodical</code> is replaced, the methods that call <code class="literal">methodical</code> will continue to work the same because
                their private <code class="literal">methodical</code> is not affected by
                modification of the instance.</p><p>Finally, we return <code class="literal">that</code>.</p><p>Let's apply this pattern to our mammal example. We don't need <code class="literal">my</code> here, so we'll just leave it out, but we will use a
                    <code class="literal">spec</code> object.</p><p>The <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">saying</code> properties are now completely private. They are accessible
                only via the privileged <code class="literal">get_name</code> and <code class="literal">says</code> methods:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4177"/><pre class="programlisting">var mammal = function (spec) {
    var that = {};

    that.get_name = function (  ) {
        return spec.name;
    };

    that.says = function (  ) {
        return spec.saying || '';
    };

    return that;
};

var myMammal = mammal({name: 'Herb'});</pre><p>In the pseudoclassical pattern, the <code class="literal">Cat</code>
                constructor function had to duplicate work that was done by the <code class="literal">Mammal</code> constructor. That isn't necessary in the
                functional pattern because the <code class="literal">Cat</code> constructor
                will call the <code class="literal">Mammal</code> constructor, letting
                    <code class="literal">Mammal</code> do most of the work of object
                creation, so <code class="literal">Cat</code> only has to concern itself with
                the differences:<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0288" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4205"/><pre class="programlisting">var cat = function (spec) {
    spec.saying = spec.saying || 'meow';
    var that = mammal(spec);
    that.purr = function (n) {
        var i, s = '';
        for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i += 1) {
            if (s) {
                s += '-';
            }
            s += 'r';
        }
        return s;
    };
    that.get_name = function () {
        return that.says() + ' ' + spec.name + ' ' + that.says();
    };
    return that;
};

var myCat = cat({name: 'Henrietta'});</pre><p>The functional pattern also gives us a way to deal with super methods. We will
                make a <code class="literal">superior</code> method that takes a method name
                and returns a function that invokes that method. The function will invoke the
                original method even if the property is changed:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4213"/><pre class="programlisting">Object.method('superior', function (name) {
    var that = this,
        method = that[name];
    return function (  ) {
        return method.apply(that, arguments);
    };
});</pre><p>Let's try it out on a <code class="literal">coolcat</code> that is just like
                    <code class="literal">cat</code> except it has a cooler <code class="literal">get_name</code> method that calls the super method. It
                requires just a little bit of preparation. We will declare a <code class="literal">super_get_name</code> variable and assign it the result of
                invoking the superior method:<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0289" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e4232"/><pre class="programlisting">var coolcat = function (spec) {
    var that = cat(spec),
        super_get_name = that.superior('get_name');
    that.get_name = function (n) {
        return 'like ' + super_get_name(  ) + ' baby';
    };
    return that;
};

var myCoolCat = coolcat({name: 'Bix'});
var name = myCoolCat.get_name(  );
//        'like meow Bix meow baby'</pre><p>The functional pattern has a great deal of flexibility. It requires less effort
                than the pseudoclassical pattern, and gives us better encapsulation and information
                hiding and access to super methods.</p><p>If all of the state of an object is private, then the object is tamper-proof.
                Properties of the object can be replaced or deleted, but the integrity of the object
                is not compromised. If we create an object in the functional style, and if all of
                the methods of the object make no use of <code class="literal">this</code> or
                    <code class="literal">that</code>, then the object is
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>durable</em></span>. A durable object is simply a collection of
                functions that act as <span class="emphasis"><em>capabilities</em></span>.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0290" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0291" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A durable object cannot be compromised. Access to a durable object does not give
                an attacker the ability to access the internal state of the object except as
                permitted by the methods.</p></div></body></html>
