                lifetimes of variables and parameters. This is an important service to the
                programmer because it reduces naming collisions and provides automatic memory

};</pre><p>Most languages with C syntax have block scope. All variables defined in a block (a
                list of statements wrapped with curly braces) are not visible from outside of the
                block. The variables defined in a block can be released when execution of the block
                is finished. This is a good thing.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0228" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Unfortunately, JavaScript does not have block scope even though its block syntax
                suggests that it does. This confusion can be a source of errors.</p><p>JavaScript does have function scope. That means that the parameters and variables
                defined in a function are not visible outside of the function, and that a variable
                defined anywhere within a function is visible everywhere within the function.</p><p>In many modern languages, it is recommended that variables be declared as late as
                possible, at the first point of use. That turns out to be bad advice for JavaScript
                because it lacks block scope. So instead, it is best to declare all of the variables
                used in a function at the top of the function body.</p></div></body></html>
