            Java, functions came from Scheme, and prototypal inheritance came from Self.
            JavaScript's Regular Expression feature was borrowed from Perl.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>regular expression</em></span> is the specification of the syntax of a
            simple language. Regular expressions are used with methods to search, replace, and
            extract information from strings. The methods that work with regular expressions are
                <code class="literal">regexp.exec</code>, <code class="literal">regexp.test</code>, <code class="literal">string.match</code>, <code class="literal">string.replace</code>, <code class="literal">string.search</code>, and <code class="literal">string.split</code>. These
            will all be described in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Methods">Chapter 8</a>. Regular expressions usually have a
            significant performance advantage over equivalent string operations in
                JavaScript.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0335" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0336" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0337" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Regular expressions came from the mathematical study of formal languages. Ken Thompson
            adapted Stephen Kleene's theoretical work on type-3 languages into a practical pattern
            matcher that could be embedded in tools such as text editors and programming
            languages.</p><p>The syntax of regular expressions in JavaScript conforms closely to the original
            formulations from Bell Labs, with some reinterpretation and extension adopted from Perl.
            The rules for writing regular expressions can be surprisingly complex because they
            interpret characters in some positions as operators, and in slightly different positions
            as literals. Worse than being hard to write, this makes regular expressions hard to read
            and dangerous to modify. It is necessary to have a fairly complete understanding of the
            full complexity of regular expressions to correctly read them. To mitigate this, I have
            simplified the rules a little. As presented here, regular expressions will be slightly
            less terse, but they will also be slightly easier to use correctly. And that is a good
            thing because regular expressions can be very difficult to maintain and debug.</p><p>Today's regular expressions are not strictly regular, but they can be very useful.
            Regular expressions tend to be extremely terse, even cryptic. They are easy to use in
            their simplest form, but they can quickly become bewildering. JavaScript's regular
            expressions are difficult to read in part because they do not allow comments or
            whitespace. All of the parts of a regular expression are pushed tightly together, making
            them almost indecipherable. This is a particular concern when they are used in security
            applications for scanning and validation. If you cannot read and understand a regular
            expression, how can you have confidence that it will work correctly for all inputs? Yet,
            despite their obvious drawbacks, regular expressions are widely used.</p><div class="sect1" title="An Example"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="an_example"/>An Example</h1></div></div></div><p>Here is an example. It is a regular expression that matches URLs. The pages of
                this book are not infinitely wide, so I broke it into two lines. In a JavaScript
                program, the regular expression must be on a single line. Whitespace is
                    significant:<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0338" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0339" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0340" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0341" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0342" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0343" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0344" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting7_d1e4918"/><pre class="programlisting">var parse_url = /^(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)

                expressions. That may make it easier to see what a regular expression does. This is

                how it works.</p><a id="I_programlisting7_d1e4969"/><pre class="programlisting">^</pre><p>The <code class="literal">^</code> character indicates the beginning of the

                . . . <code class="literal">)</code> indicates a noncapturing group. The
                suffix <code class="literal">?</code> indicates that the group is
                    optional.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0347" class="indexterm"/></p><p>It means <span class="emphasis"><em>repeat zero or one time</em></span>. The ( . . . ) indicates a
                capturing group. A capturing group copies the text it matches and places it in the
                    <code class="literal">result</code> array. Each capturing group is given a
                number. This first capturing group is 1, so a copy of the text matched by this
                capturing group will appear in <code class="literal">result[1]</code>. The [ .
                . . ] indicates a character class. This character class, <code class="literal">A-Za-z</code>, contains 26 uppercase letters and 26 lowercase letters. The
                hyphens indicate ranges, from A to Z. The suffix <code class="literal">+</code> indicates that the character class will be matched one or more
                times. The group is followed by the <code class="literal">:</code> character,
                which will be matched literally.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0348" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-7-0349" class="indexterm"/></p><a id="I_programlisting7_d1e5031"/><pre class="programlisting">(\/{0,3})</pre><p>The next factor is capturing group 2. <code class="literal">\/</code>
                indicates that a <code class="literal">/</code> (slash) character should be

                it is not misinterpreted as the end of the regular expression literal. The suffix
                    <code class="literal">{0,3}</code> indicates that the <code class="literal">/</code> will be matched 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 times.</p><a id="I_programlisting7_d1e5050"/><pre class="programlisting">([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)</pre><p>The next factor is capturing group 3.

                escaped <code class="literal">as \-</code> to prevent it from being confused

                more digits preceded by a <code class="literal">:</code>. <code class="literal">\d</code> represents a digit character. The series of one or
                more digits will be capturing group 4.</p><a id="I_programlisting7_d1e5077"/><pre class="programlisting">(?:\/([^?#]*))?</pre><p>We have another optional group. This one begins with a <code class="literal">/</code>. The character class <code class="literal">[^?#]</code>
                begins with a <code class="literal">^</code>, which indicates that the class
                includes all characters <span class="emphasis">except ? and #</span>. The <code class="literal">*</code> indicates that the character class is matched zero
                or more times.<a id="IDX-CHP-7-0350" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Note that I am being sloppy here. The class of all characters <span class="emphasis"><em>except ?
                    and #</em></span> includes line-ending characters, control characters, and lots
                of other characters that really shouldn't be matched here. Most of the time this
                will do what we want, but there is a risk that some bad text could slip through.
                Sloppy regular expressions are a popular source of security exploits. It is a lot
                easier to write sloppy regular expressions than rigorous regular

Regular
                expressions are best when they are short and simple. Only then can we have
                confidence that they are working correctly and that they could be successfully
                modified if necessary.</p><p>There is a very high degree of compatibility between JavaScript language
                processors. The part of the language that is <span class="emphasis"><em>least</em></span> portable is
                the implementation of regular expressions. Regular expressions that are very
                complicated or convoluted are more likely to have portability problems. Nested
                regular expressions can also suffer horrible performance problems in some
                implementations. Simplicity is the best strategy.</p><p>Let's look at another example: a regular expression that matches numbers. Numbers
                can have an integer part with an optional minus sign, an optional fractional part,

                the anchors, it tells us if the string contains only a number. If we included just
