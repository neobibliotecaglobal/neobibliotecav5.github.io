                FORTRAN IV computed <code class="literal">go to</code> statement. Each case
                falls through into the next case unless you explicitly disrupt the flow.</p><p>Someone wrote to me once suggesting that JSLint should give a warning when a case
                falls through into another case. He pointed out that this is a very common source of
                errors, and it is a difficult error to see in the code. I answered that that was all
                true, but that the benefit of compactness obtained by falling through more than
                compensated for the chance of error.</p><p>The next day, he reported that there was an error in JSLint. It was misidentifying
                an error. I investigated, and it turned out that I had a case that was falling
                through. In that moment, I achieved enlightenment. I no longer use intentional fall
                throughs. That discipline makes it much easier to find the unintentional fall
                throughs.</p><p>The worst features of a language aren't the features that are obviously dangerous
                or useless. Those are easily avoided. The worst features are the attractive
                nuisances, the features that are both useful and dangerous.</p></div></body></html>
