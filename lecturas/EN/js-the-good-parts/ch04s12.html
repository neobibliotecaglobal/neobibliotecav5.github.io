A module is a function or object
                that presents an interface but that hides its state and implementation. By using
                functions to produce modules, we can almost completely eliminate our use of global
                variables, thereby mitigating one of JavaScript's worst features.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0235" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0236" class="indexterm"/></p><p>For example, suppose we want to augment <code class="literal">String</code>
                with a <code class="literal">deentityify</code> method. Its job is to look for
                HTML entities in a string and replace them with their equivalents. It makes sense to
                keep the names of the entities and their equivalents in an object. But where should
                we keep the object? We could put it in a global variable, but global variables are
                evil. We could define it in the function itself, but that has a runtime cost because
                the literal must be evaluated every time the function is invoked. The ideal approach
                is to put it in a closure, and perhaps provide an extra method that can add
                additional entities:</p><a id="I_programlisting4_d1e3354"/><pre class="programlisting">String.method('deentityify', function (  ) {

// The entity table. It maps entity names to
// characters.

    var entity = {
        quot: '"',
        lt:   '&lt;',
        gt:   '&gt;'
    };

// Return the deentityify method.

    return function (  ) {

// This is the deentityify method. It calls the string
// replace method, looking for substrings that start
// with '&amp;' and end with ';'. If the characters in
// between are in the entity table, then replace the
// entity with the character from the table. It uses
// a regular expression (Chapter 7).

        return this.replace(/&amp;([^&amp;;]+);/g,
            function (a, b) {
                var r = entity[b];
                return typeof r === 'string' ? r : a;
            }
        );
    };
}(  ));</pre><p>Notice the last line. We immediately invoke the function we just made with the
                    <code class="literal">( )</code> operator. That invocation creates and
                returns the function that becomes the <code class="literal">deentityify</code>
                method.</p><a id="I_programlisting4_d1e3364"/><pre class="programlisting">document.writeln(
    '&amp;lt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;'.deentityify(  ));  // &lt;"&gt;</pre><p>The module pattern takes advantage of function scope and closure to create
                relationships that are binding and private. In this example, only the <code class="literal">deentityify</code> method has access to the entity data
                structure.</p><p>The general pattern of a module is a function that defines private variables and
                functions; creates privileged functions which, through closure, will have access to
                the private variables and functions; and that returns the privileged functions or
                stores them in an accessible place.<a id="IDX-CHP-4-0237" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-4-0238" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Use of the module pattern can eliminate the use of global variables. It promotes
                information hiding and other good design practices. It is very effective in
                encapsulating applications and other singletons.</p><p>It can also be used to produce objects that are secure. Let's suppose we want to
                make an object that produces a serial number:</p><a id="I_programlisting4_d1e3387"/><pre class="programlisting">var serial_maker = function (  ) {

// Produce an object that produces unique strings. A
// unique string is made up of two parts: a prefix
// and a sequence number. The object comes with
// methods for setting the prefix and sequence
// number, and a gensym method that produces unique
// strings.

    var prefix = '';
    var seq = 0;
    return {
        set_prefix: function (p) {
            prefix = String(p);
        },
        set_seq: function (s) {
            seq = s;
        },
        gensym: function ( ) {
            var result = prefix + seq;
            seq += 1;
            return result;
        }
    };
};
var seqer = serial_maker( );
seqer.set_prefix('Q');
seqer.set_seq(1000);
var unique = seqer.gensym( ); // unique is "Q1000"</pre><p>The methods do not make use of <code class="literal">this</code> or <code class="literal">that</code>. As a result, there is no way to compromise the
                    <code class="literal">seqer</code>. It isn't possible to get or change the
                    <code class="literal">prefix</code> or <code class="literal">seq</code> except as permitted by the methods. The <code class="literal">seqer</code> object is mutable, so the methods could be replaced, but that
                still does not give access to its secrets. <code class="literal">seqer</code>
                is simply a collection of functions, and those functions are capabilities that grant
                specific powers to use or modify the secret state.</p><p>If we passed <code class="literal">seqer.gensym</code> to a third party's
                function, that function would be able to generate unique strings, but would be
                unable to change the <code class="literal">prefix</code> or <code class="literal">seq</code>.</p></div></body></html>
