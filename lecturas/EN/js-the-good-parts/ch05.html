            If a new class is mostly similar to an existing class, you only have to specify the
            differences. Patterns of code reuse are extremely important because they have the
            potential to significantly reduce the cost of software development. The other benefit of
            classical inheritance is that it includes the specification of a system of types. This
            mostly frees the programmer from having to write explicit casting operations, which is a
            very good thing because when casting, the safety benefits of a type system are
                lost.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0251" class="indexterm"/></p><p>JavaScript, being a loosely typed language, never casts. The lineage of an object is
            irrelevant. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is descended
                from.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0252" class="indexterm"/></p><p>JavaScript provides a much richer set of code reuse patterns. It can ape the classical
            pattern, but it also supports other patterns that are more expressive. The set of
            possible inheritance patterns in JavaScript is vast. In this chapter, we'll look at a
            few of the most straightforward patterns. Much more complicated constructions are
            possible, but it is usually best to keep it simple.</p><p>In classical languages, objects are instances of classes, and a class can inherit from
            another class. JavaScript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit
            directly from other objects.</p><div class="sect1" title="Pseudoclassical"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pseudoclassical"/>Pseudoclassical</h1></div></div></div><p>JavaScript is conflicted about its prototypal nature. Its prototype mechanism is
                obscured by some complicated syntactic business that looks vaguely classical.
                Instead of having objects inherit directly from other objects, an unnecessary level
                of indirection is inserted such that objects are produced by constructor
                    functions.<a id="IDX-CHP-5-0253" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0254" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0255" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0256" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0257" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0258" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0259" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0260" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0261" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0262" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0263" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0264" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0265" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0266" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0267" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0268" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0269" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-5-0270" class="indexterm"/></p><p>When a function object is created, the <code class="literal">Function</code>
                constructor that produces the function object runs some code like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3736"/><pre class="programlisting">this.prototype = {constructor: this};</pre><p>The new function object is given a <code class="literal">prototype</code>
                property whose value is an object containing a <code class="literal">constructor</code> property whose value is the new function object. The
                    <code class="literal">prototype</code> object is the place where inherited
                traits are to be deposited. Every function gets a <code class="literal">prototype</code> object because the language does not provide a way of
                determining which functions are intended to be used as constructors. The <code class="literal">constructor</code> property is not useful. It is the <code class="literal">prototype</code> object that is important.</p><p>When a function is invoked with the constructor invocation pattern using the new
                prefix, this modifies the way in which the function is executed. If the <code class="literal">new</code> operator were a method instead of an operator, it
                could have been implemented like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3764"/><pre class="programlisting">Function.method('new', function (  ) {

// Create a new object that inherits from the
// constructor's prototype.

    var that = Object.beget(this.prototype);

// Invoke the constructor, binding -this- to
// the new object.

    var other = this.apply(that, arguments);

// If its return value isn't an object,
// substitute the new object.

    return (typeof other === 'object' &amp;&amp; other) || that;
});</pre><p>We can define a constructor and augment its <code class="literal">prototype</code>:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3771"/><pre class="programlisting">var Mammal = function (name) {
    this.name = name;
};

Mammal.prototype.get_name = function (  ) {
    return this.name;
};

Mammal.prototype.says = function (  ) {
    return this.saying || '';
};</pre><p>Now, we can make an instance:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3775"/><pre class="programlisting">var myMammal = new Mammal('Herb the Mammal');
var name = myMammal.get_name(  ); // 'Herb the Mammal'</pre><p>We can make another pseudoclass that inherits from <code class="literal">Mammal</code> by defining its <code class="literal">constructor</code>
                function and replacing its <code class="literal">prototype</code> with an
                instance of <code class="literal">Mammal</code>:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3792"/><pre class="programlisting">var Cat = function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.saying = 'meow';
};

// Replace Cat.prototype with a new instance of Mammal

Cat.prototype = new Mammal(  );

// Augment the new prototype with
// purr and get_name methods.

Cat.prototype.purr = function (n) {
    var i, s = '';
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i += 1) {
        if (s) {
            s += '-';
        }
        s += 'r';
    }
    return s;
};
Cat.prototype.get_name = function (  ) {
    return this.says(  ) + ' ' + this.name + ' ' + this.says(  );
};

var myCat = new Cat('Henrietta');
var says = myCat.says(  ); // 'meow'
var purr = myCat.purr(5); // 'r-r-r-r-r'
var name = myCat.get_name(  );
//            'meow Henrietta meow'</pre><p>The pseudoclassical pattern was intended to look sort of object-oriented, but it
                is looking quite alien. We can hide some of the ugliness by using the <code class="literal">method</code> method and defining an <code class="literal">inherits</code> method:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3802"/><pre class="programlisting">Function.method('inherits', function (Parent) {
    this.prototype = new Parent(  );
    return this;
});</pre><p>Our <code class="literal">inherits</code> and <code class="literal">method</code> methods return <code class="literal">this</code>,
                allowing us to program in a cascade style. We can now make our <code class="literal">Cat</code> with one statement.</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e3818"/><pre class="programlisting">var Cat = function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.saying = 'meow';
}.
    inherits(Mammal).
    method('purr', function (n) {
        var i, s = '';
        for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i += 1) {
            if (s) {
                s += '-';
            }
            s += 'r';
        }
        return s;
    }).
    method('get_name', function (  ) {
        return this.says(  ) + ' ' + this.name + ' ' + this.says(  );
    });</pre><p>By hiding the <code class="literal">prototype</code> jazz, it now looks a
                bit less alien. But have we really improved anything? We now have constructor
                functions that act like classes, but at the edges, there may be surprising behavior.
                There is no privacy; all properties are public. There is no access to <code class="literal">super</code> methods.</p><p>Even worse, there is a serious hazard with the use of constructor functions. If
                you forget to include the <code class="literal">new</code> prefix when calling
                a constructor function, then <code class="literal">this</code> will not be
                bound to a new object. Sadly, <code class="literal">this</code> will be bound
                to the global object, so instead of augmenting your new object, you will be
                clobbering global variables. That is really bad. There is no compile warning, and
                there is no runtime warning.</p><p>This is a serious design error in the language. To mitigate this problem, there is
                a convention that all constructor functions are named with an initial capital, and
                that nothing else is spelled with an initial capital. This gives us a prayer that
                visual inspection can find a missing <code class="literal">new</code>. A much
                better alternative is to not use <code class="literal">new</code> at
                all.</p><p>The pseudoclassical form can provide comfort to programmers who are unfamiliar
                with JavaScript, but it also hides the true nature of the language. The classically
                inspired notation can induce programmers to compose hierarchies that are
                unnecessarily deep and complicated. Much of the complexity of class hierarchies is
                motivated by the constraints of static type checking. JavaScript is completely free
                of those constraints. In classical languages, class inheritance is the only form of
                code reuse. JavaScript has more and better options.</p></div></div></body></html>
